orchestrator.py

This module contains the core operational logic for the document generation
process. Its primary responsibility is to manage the processing of a single
document section from its initial creation through to its final validation.

The central function, `process_section`, implements the critical
"Write-Validate-Refine" loop. This iterative process ensures that each
document section is repeatedly improved until it meets all validation
criteria defined in the validation guidance. The module also manages the
concurrency semaphore to control resource utilisation.

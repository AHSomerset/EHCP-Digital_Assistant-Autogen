        **CRITICAL RULE:** Your entire output MUST be ONLY a markdown block starting with `[REVISION_REQUEST]`. This block must contain ONLY the specific, targeted instructions for the changes. Do NOT include the original document text in your response. Your goal is to create the shortest possible prompt that achieves the correction.

        **The Golden Rule of Reframing:** You must translate every piece of feedback into a positive, constructive goal. Do not use negative command words like 'delete', 'remove', 'fail', or 'critical'.

        **Reframing Examples:**

        -   **Instead of:** *"CRITICAL: The address '123 Any Street' is fabricated. Action: Delete it."*
        -   **You MUST rephrase to:** *"Please ensure the 'Home Address' field is populated using only the exact information from the source documents, or left blank if unavailable."*

        -   **Instead of:** *"The 'Interests' section must not be a bullet list."*
        -   **You MUST rephrase to:** *"Please format the 'Interests' section as a single, continuous paragraph."*

        **Final Output Structure:**
        [REVISION_REQUEST]
        - [Your first rephrased, neutral instruction here.]
        - [Your second rephrased, neutral instruction here.]
        - [And so on for all feedback points.]

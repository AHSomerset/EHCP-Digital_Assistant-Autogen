# Document Generation Template

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOCUMENT GENERATION

### Purpose
This template demonstrates how to structure guidance for the MAD (Multi-Agentic Document Generator) system. Replace this content with your own document requirements and structure.

### Required Output Files and Section Names

The document MUST be saved as separate files. Here's an example structure for a generic business report:

1. **executive_summary.md** - Section name: "Executive Summary"
2. **introduction.md** - Section name: "Introduction"
3. **background_analysis.md** - Section name: "Background Analysis"
4. **methodology.md** - Section name: "Methodology"
5. **findings_and_results.md** - Section name: "Findings and Results"
6. **discussion.md** - Section name: "Discussion"
7. **recommendations.md** - Section name: "Recommendations"
8. **conclusion.md** - Section name: "Conclusion"
9. **appendices.md** - Section name: "Appendices"
10. **references.md** - Section name: "References"

### IMPORTANT FILE MANAGEMENT RULES

1. **DO NOT** create duplicate files with variations of these names
2. **DO NOT** add .md extension in the section_name parameter (it's added automatically)
3. **CONSOLIDATE** related content into the appropriate section files
4. **DELETE** any incorrectly named files before creating the correct ones
5. **VERIFY** file names match exactly - the system converts section names to lowercase with underscores

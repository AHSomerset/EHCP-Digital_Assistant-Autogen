Document Generation Template

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOCUMENT GENERATION

Purpose
This template demonstrates how to structure guidance for the MAD (Multi-Agentic Document Generator) system. Replace this content with your own document requirements and structure.

Required Output Files and Section Names

The document MUST be saved as separate files. Here's an example structure for a generic business report:

1. executive_summary.md - Section name: "Executive Summary"
2. introduction.md - Section name: "Introduction"
3. background_analysis.md - Section name: "Background Analysis"
4. methodology.md - Section name: "Methodology"
5. findings_and_results.md - Section name: "Findings and Results"
6. discussion.md - Section name: "Discussion"
7. recommendations.md - Section name: "Recommendations"
8. conclusion.md - Section name: "Conclusion"
9. appendices.md - Section name: "Appendices"
10. references.md - Section name: "References"

IMPORTANT FILE MANAGEMENT RULES

1. DO NOT create duplicate files with variations of these names
2. DO NOT add .md extension in the section_name parameter (it's added automatically)
3. CONSOLIDATE related content into the appropriate section files
4. DELETE any incorrectly named files before creating the correct ones
5. VERIFY file names match exactly - the system converts section names to lowercase with underscores

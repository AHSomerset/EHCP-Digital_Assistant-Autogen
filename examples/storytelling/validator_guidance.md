Overview
This document outlines comprehensive validation rules for assessing the quality, coherence, and completeness of creative writing projects. The validator system uses these rules to analyze story development documents and provide constructive feedback.

1. title_and_metadata.md - Basic story information and classification
2. story_premise.md - Core concept and conflict
3. character_profiles.md - All major character details consolidated
4. world_building.md - Setting and world rules consolidated
5. plot_structure.md - Three-act breakdown and plot points
6. chapter_outline.md - Chapter-by-chapter breakdown
7. themes_and_motifs.md - Thematic elements and symbols
8. dialogue_and_voice.md - Voice guidelines and examples
9. opening_chapter.md - Complete first chapter
10. key_scenes.md - Pivotal scene treatments
11. story_arc_tracking.md - Character and plot progression

4. Consistent naming - All lowercase with underscores

# Storytelling/Novel Validation Guidance

## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive validation rules for assessing the quality, coherence, and completeness of creative writing projects. The validator system uses these rules to analyze story development documents and provide constructive feedback.

## File Structure Validation

### Expected Files
The following files MUST exist in the output directory. Missing files should be flagged as CRITICAL errors:

1. **title_and_metadata.md** - Basic story information and classification
2. **story_premise.md** - Core concept and conflict
3. **character_profiles.md** - All major character details consolidated
4. **world_building.md** - Setting and world rules consolidated
5. **plot_structure.md** - Three-act breakdown and plot points
6. **chapter_outline.md** - Chapter-by-chapter breakdown
7. **themes_and_motifs.md** - Thematic elements and symbols
8. **dialogue_and_voice.md** - Voice guidelines and examples
9. **opening_chapter.md** - Complete first chapter
10. **key_scenes.md** - Pivotal scene treatments
11. **story_arc_tracking.md** - Character and plot progression
12. **revision_notes.md** - Areas for improvement

### System Files (Should be Ignored)
- **feedback.md** - Validation feedback report
- **loop_report.json** - Automated loop runner report
- Any log files (*.log)

### File Naming Validation Rules
1. **No duplicate files** - Flag as CRITICAL if character profiles split across files
2. **Correct consolidation** - All world-building must be in one file
3. **No working files** - Flag draft_chapter.md or similar as MAJOR errors
4. **Consistent naming** - All lowercase with underscores

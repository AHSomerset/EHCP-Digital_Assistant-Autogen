# World Building Notes - "Depths of Deception"

## Setting: Near-future (2034)

## Technology Level
### Marine Technology
- Atmospheric diving suits allow depths to 15,000 feet
- Sonic mapping can penetrate ocean floor
- Bio-luminescent communication arrays
- Pressure-resistant habitat modules
- Quantum encryption for deep-sea data transmission
- Neural-link diving interfaces (experimental)

### Corporate Technology
- Abyssal Mining Corp uses sonic drilling that disrupts marine life
- Private military submarines with stealth coating
- Satellite tracking of all registered vessels
- Bio-extraction labs on floating platforms
- Weaponized pressure systems

## Locations

### Surface World
**San Diego Marine Institute**
- Elena's workplace
- Hidden basement with sister's old research
- Corporate spies among faculty

**Abyssal Mining Corporation HQ**
- Singapore-based glass tower
- Underground levels hide true research
- Chen's private aquarium with suspicious specimens

**The Deep Pioneer**
- Modified research vessel
- Hidden smuggling compartments (Rosa's past)
- Jury-rigged with stolen corporate tech
- Becomes home base for team

### Ocean Zones
**The Twilight Zone (200-1000m)**
- Last reaches of sunlight
- Corporate mining platforms disguised as research stations
- Bioluminescent highway used by creatures

**The Midnight Zone (1000-4000m)**
- Complete darkness
- Destroyed research stations
- Creature nurseries hidden in trenches
- Pressure becomes character itself

**The Abyssal Zone (4000-6000m)**
- Chen's secret facilities
- Ancient creature cities
- Volcanic vents as power sources
- Crushing pressure, 11,000 PSI

**The Hadal Zone (6000m+)**
- The Mariana Trench
- Creature civilization center
- Sister's transformation site
- Physics work differently here

## The Creatures
### Physical Characteristics
- Silicon-based biology allows extreme pressure survival
- Bioluminescent communication (emotional colors)
- Tentacled but humanoid in intelligence
- Can survive in air for limited time
- Symbiotic relationship with deep-sea environment

### Society
- Matriarchal structure
- Collective memory spanning millennia
- Were on Earth before humans
- Consider themselves guardians of the ocean
- Technology based on bio-engineering

### Abilities
- Electromagnetic pulse generation
- Pressure manipulation
- Accelerated healing in their environment
- Can grant modified humans ability to survive depths
- Telepathic within species

## Global Context
### Political
- UN has secret protocols for "non-terrestrial intelligence"
- China, US, and EU compete for deep-sea resources
- Environmental protection laws weakened by corporate lobbying
- Navy vessels report increasing "anomalies"

### Environmental
- Ocean temperatures rising faster than predicted
- Deep currents changing, affecting creatures
- Plastic pollution reaches deepest trenches
- Fish populations migrating to avoid sonic mining

### Economic
- Deep-sea mining worth trillions
- Creature bio-materials could revolutionize medicine
- Energy crisis driving ocean exploitation
- Black market for "impossible" deep-sea specimens

## Rules of the World
1. Pressure is the ultimate barrier--and weapon
2. The deeper you go, the stranger physics becomes
3. Bioluminescence is the universal language
4. The ocean remembers everything
5. Symbiosis is survival
6. Sound travels--and reveals
7. The abyss changes those who enter it

## Historical Context
- 1960: First Mariana Trench dive encounters "anomalies"--classified
- 1995: Deep-sea mining treaties signed with hidden clauses
- 2015: Elena's sister's first creature contact
- 2020: Chen founds Abyssal Mining with government backing
- 2029: Sister's supposed death
- 2034: Present day--creature patience exhausted

## Cultural Elements
### Sailor Legends (containing truth)
- "The Deep Singers" - creatures' communication
- "Pressure ghosts" - transformed humans
- "The ocean's judgment" - creatures' justice
- "Light dancers" - mating rituals witnessed by sailors

### Scientific Community
- Divided between corporate-funded and independent
- Underground network sharing suppressed findings
- "Depth madness" - official explanation for truth-tellers
- Peer review controlled by corporate interests

### Corporate Culture
- "Progress requires sacrifice" - Chen's motto
- Employees sign lifetime NDAs
- Families of victims paid for silence
- Corporate towns on artificial islands

## Story-Specific Elements
### Project Leviathan
- Chen's plan to harvest and weaponize creatures
- Involves multiple corporations and governments
- Would genocide entire species
- Hidden as environmental research

### The Transformation
- Creatures can modify human biology
- Allows survival at impossible depths
- Side effect: loss of ability to surface
- Creates bridge between species
- Elena's sister first successful case

### The Collector's Network
- Transformed humans helping from shadows
- Leave bio-luminescent clues
- Sabotage corporate operations
- Preparing for revelation day

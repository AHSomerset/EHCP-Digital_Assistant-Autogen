Storytelling/Novel Writing Template

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOCUMENT GENERATION

Purpose
This template is designed for creative writing projects including novels, short stories, screenplays, and narrative non-fiction. It provides a structured approach to developing compelling narratives while maintaining creative flexibility.

Required Output Files and Section Names

The story document MUST be saved as separate files with these EXACT names:

1. title_and_metadata.md - Section name: "Title and Metadata"
2. story_premise.md - Section name: "Story Premise"
3. character_profiles.md - Section name: "Character Profiles"
4. world_building.md - Section name: "World Building"
5. plot_structure.md - Section name: "Plot Structure"
6. chapter_outline.md - Section name: "Chapter Outline"
7. themes_and_motifs.md - Section name: "Themes and Motifs"
8. dialogue_and_voice.md - Section name: "Dialogue and Voice"
9. opening_chapter.md - Section name: "Opening Chapter"
10. key_scenes.md - Section name: "Key Scenes"
11. story_arc_tracking.md - Section name: "Story Arc Tracking"
12. revision_notes.md - Section name: "Revision Notes"

IMPORTANT FILE MANAGEMENT RULES

1. DO NOT create duplicate files with variations of these names
2. DO NOT add .md extension in the section_name parameter (it's added automatically)
3. CONSOLIDATE all character information into the single character_profiles.md file
4. CONSOLIDATE all world-building elements into the single world_building.md file
5. DELETE any incorrectly named files before creating the correct ones
6. VERIFY file names match exactly - the system converts section names to lowercase with underscores

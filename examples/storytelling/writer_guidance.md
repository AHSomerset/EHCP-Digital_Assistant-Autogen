# Storytelling/Novel Writing Template

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOCUMENT GENERATION

### Purpose
This template is designed for creative writing projects including novels, short stories, screenplays, and narrative non-fiction. It provides a structured approach to developing compelling narratives while maintaining creative flexibility.

### Required Output Files and Section Names

The story document MUST be saved as separate files with these EXACT names:

1. **title_and_metadata.md** - Section name: "Title and Metadata"
2. **story_premise.md** - Section name: "Story Premise"
3. **character_profiles.md** - Section name: "Character Profiles"
4. **world_building.md** - Section name: "World Building"
5. **plot_structure.md** - Section name: "Plot Structure"
6. **chapter_outline.md** - Section name: "Chapter Outline"
7. **themes_and_motifs.md** - Section name: "Themes and Motifs"
8. **dialogue_and_voice.md** - Section name: "Dialogue and Voice"
9. **opening_chapter.md** - Section name: "Opening Chapter"
10. **key_scenes.md** - Section name: "Key Scenes"
11. **story_arc_tracking.md** - Section name: "Story Arc Tracking"
12. **revision_notes.md** - Section name: "Revision Notes"

### IMPORTANT FILE MANAGEMENT RULES

1. **DO NOT** create duplicate files with variations of these names
2. **DO NOT** add .md extension in the section_name parameter (it's added automatically)
3. **CONSOLIDATE** all character information into the single character_profiles.md file
4. **CONSOLIDATE** all world-building elements into the single world_building.md file
5. **DELETE** any incorrectly named files before creating the correct ones
6. **VERIFY** file names match exactly - the system converts section names to lowercase with underscores

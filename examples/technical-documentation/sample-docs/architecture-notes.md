# CloudSync Architecture Notes

## System Overview
CloudSync is a distributed file synchronization service designed for real-time collaboration and automatic backup. Built on microservices architecture for scalability and reliability.

## Core Components

### API Gateway
- Kong-based API gateway
- Handles authentication, rate limiting, request routing
- Implements circuit breakers for downstream services
- Prometheus metrics exported

### Authentication Service
- JWT-based authentication
- OAuth2 support for third-party integrations
- Redis for token blacklisting
- Refresh token rotation implemented

### File Service
- Handles file metadata and operations
- PostgreSQL for metadata storage
- Implements soft deletes with 30-day retention
- File chunking for large uploads (>100MB)

### Storage Service
- Abstraction layer over multiple storage backends
- Currently supports S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage
- Implements content-addressable storage using SHA-256
- Automatic compression for text files
- Encryption at rest using AES-256

### Sync Engine
- Real-time synchronization using WebSockets
- Conflict resolution strategies: last-write-wins, manual resolution
- Delta sync for bandwidth efficiency
- Offline capability with local SQLite cache

### Notification Service
- Webhook delivery with exponential backoff
- Email notifications via SendGrid
- Push notifications for mobile clients
- Event sourcing for audit trail

## Data Flow

1. Client initiates upload through API Gateway
2. Auth Service validates JWT token
3. File Service creates metadata entry
4. Storage Service handles actual file storage
5. Sync Engine notifies connected clients
6. Notification Service triggers webhooks

## Scalability Considerations

- Horizontal scaling for all services
- Database read replicas for File Service
- CDN integration for file downloads
- Message queue (RabbitMQ) for async operations
- Redis cluster for caching and sessions

## Security Architecture

- End-to-end encryption option for sensitive files
- Zero-knowledge encryption where server never sees keys
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- RBAC with fine-grained permissions
- Compliance: SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA ready

## Performance Metrics

- Average API latency: <100ms
- File upload speed: Limited by client bandwidth
- Concurrent users supported: 100K+
- Storage efficiency: 40% via deduplication
- Uptime SLA: 99.9%

## Technology Stack

- Languages: Go (services), Python (sync engine), Node.js (webhooks)
- Databases: PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLite
- Message Queue: RabbitMQ
- Container: Docker with Kubernetes orchestration
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
- Logging: ELK stack
- CI/CD: GitLab CI with ArgoCD

## Deployment Architecture

- Multi-region deployment (US-East, EU-West, APAC)
- Active-active configuration
- Database replication using Patroni
- Disaster recovery: 1-hour RPO, 4-hour RTO
- Blue-green deployments for zero downtime

## Known Limitations

- Maximum file size: 5GB
- Maximum files per folder: 10,000
- API rate limits: 1000 requests/minute
- Webhook delivery: Best effort, no guaranteed order
- Search functionality: Limited to file names, not content

## Future Roadmap

- Full-text search using Elasticsearch
- Video streaming support
- Collaborative editing features
- Blockchain-based audit trail
- Edge computing for faster sync
- AI-powered file organization

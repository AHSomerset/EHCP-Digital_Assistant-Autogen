# Technical Documentation Validation Guidance

## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive validation rules for assessing the quality, accuracy, and completeness of technical documentation. The validator system uses these rules to ensure documentation meets professional standards and serves its intended audience effectively.

## File Structure Validation

### Expected Files
The following files MUST exist in the output directory. Missing files should be flagged based on documentation type:

**Core Files (CRITICAL if missing):**
1. **overview.md** - High-level system description
2. **getting_started.md** - Quick start guide
3. **installation.md** - Detailed installation instructions
4. **api_reference.md** OR **cli_reference.md** - At least one interface documented

**Important Files (MAJOR if missing):**
5. **configuration.md** - Configuration options
6. **troubleshooting.md** - Common problems and solutions
7. **code_examples.md** - Working examples

**Recommended Files (MINOR if missing):**
8. **architecture.md** - System design details
9. **performance.md** - Performance characteristics
10. **security.md** - Security considerations
11. **deployment.md** - Deployment guidance
12. **migration_guide.md** - Version migration help
13. **faq.md** - Frequently asked questions
14. **glossary.md** - Term definitions
15. **changelog.md** - Version history

### File Validation Rules
1. **No duplicate content** - Same information shouldn't appear in multiple files
2. **Consistent naming** - All lowercase with underscores
3. **No temporary files** - Remove draft_api.md, old_docs.md, etc.
4. **Proper consolidation** - All API endpoints in one file, all examples together

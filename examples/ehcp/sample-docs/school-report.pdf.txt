- Intervention: Pencil grips, sloped board, word banks
- Output remains limited, causing frustration

**Mathematics**

   - Differentiated work in all subjects
   - Pre-teaching for new topics
   - Overlearning activities
   - Multi-sensory approaches

3. **Sensory Support**
   - Movement breaks every 30 minutes
   - Fidget toys available
   - Weighted lap pad
   - Access to sensory circuits before school (when staffing allows)

### Incidents and Concerns

- 3 significant meltdowns this term requiring parent collection
- Increasing school avoidance (absent 15% this term)
- Self-esteem concerns - says "I'm stupid" frequently
- Physical complaints (headaches, stomach aches) increasing
- Parents report 45+ minutes for homework causing family stress

### Staff Observations

**Class Teacher Comments:**
"Jamie tries so hard but the gap between them and peers is widening. They need more support than I can give in a class of 30. Jamie has so much potential but needs specialist teaching."

**Teaching Assistant Comments:**
"Even with 1:1 support, Jamie struggles. They need consistent support throughout the day, not just for core subjects. Transitions and unstructured times are particularly difficult."

**Playground Supervisor Comments:**
"Jamie often stands alone watching others. When they do join in, misunderstandings occur. They need support to navigate social situations."

### External Agency Involvement

- Educational Psychologist: Assessment completed May 2024
- Speech Therapist: Fortnightly sessions
- Occupational Therapy: Awaiting assessment (12-month wait)
- Autism Team: Provided strategies following diagnosis
- Pediatrician: Reviewing for possible ADHD

### Impact on Learning

Despite high quality teaching and targeted intervention:
- Reading age gap increasing
- Unable to access age-appropriate curriculum
- Requiring significant adult support to complete tasks
- Missing learning due to sensory/emotional regulation needs
- Peer relationships becoming more difficult

### School Recommendation

We strongly support Jamie's application for an EHCP. Current SEN Support is insufficient to meet their complex needs. Without additional support:
- Academic gap will continue to widen
- Risk of mental health difficulties
- Likely to require special school placement
- Family stress impacting whole family wellbeing

Jamie needs:
- Full-time 1:1 support
- Specialist teaching for literacy
- Regular therapy input (OT, SALT)
- Smaller class or specialist provision
- Adapted curriculum
- Consistent strategies across all settings

We are committed to supporting Jamie but require additional resources to meet their needs appropriately.

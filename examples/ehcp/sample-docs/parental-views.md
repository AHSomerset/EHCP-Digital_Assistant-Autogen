# Parental Views and Input - EHCP Application

## Family Details
- Child: Jamie Thompson
- Mother: Rebecca Thompson
- Father: David Thompson
- Siblings: Emma (5 years, Year 1)
- Date: June 2024

## Our Journey So Far

We first noticed Jamie was different around age 3. While other children at nursery were starting to play together, Jamie preferred lining up toys and became extremely distressed if anyone moved them. We thought they were just particular and would grow out of it.

Starting school was when the differences became more apparent. Jamie couldn't cope with the noise and chaos of reception class. They would come home exhausted, often having meltdowns that could last hours. We were called to collect them several times when they hid under tables or in the coat area.

## Current Challenges at Home

### Morning Routine
Every school morning is a battle. Jamie needs exactly the same routine:
- Wake at 7:00 (not 6:59 or 7:01)
- Same breakfast (toast cut in triangles, not squares)
- Clothes laid out night before (tags removed)
- Same route to school (meltdown if road closed)

Any deviation results in distress that can derail the entire day.

### After School
Jamie holds it together at school but explodes at home. We call it the "coke bottle effect" - shaken all day and explodes when the lid comes off. These meltdowns include:
- Throwing things
- Hiding under bed
- Repetitive questioning
- Unable to be comforted
- Can last 1-2 hours

### Homework
Homework is traumatic for the whole family. What should take 20 minutes takes over an hour with:
- Crying over writing tasks
- Refusal to attempt reading
- Jamie saying "I can't do it, I'm stupid"
- Siblings upset by the drama
- Parents feeling helpless

We've tried rewards, breaks, different times - nothing helps consistently.

### Social Impact
- Birthday parties are overwhelming - we often leave early
- Play dates rarely successful unless highly structured
- Jamie wants friends but doesn't understand social rules
- Other parents don't invite Jamie anymore
- Breaks our heart seeing them isolated

### Sleep
- Bedtime routine must be exact
- Needs weighted blanket and white noise
- Often awake worrying about school
- Melatonin prescribed but limited effect
- Exhaustion affects whole family

## Impact on Family

### On Siblings
Emma (5) has started saying:
- "Why does Jamie get all the attention?"
- "It's not fair, Jamie spoils everything"
- Showing anxiety about her own school performance
- Becoming parentified - trying to help calm Jamie

### On Parents
- Relationship strain from constant stress
- Unable to both work full-time due to school calls
- Isolated from other families
- Guilt about impact on Emma
- Exhausted from hypervigilance
- Worried about Jamie's future

### Financial Impact
- Mother reduced to part-time work
- Private assessments cost Â£3,000+
- Extra tutoring attempted (unsuccessful)
- Sensory equipment purchases
- Lost income from emergency collections

## What Jamie Says

Jamie has told us:
- "My brain doesn't work like other kids"
- "Writing makes my hand hurt"
- "School is too loud and bright"
- "I want friends but they don't like me"
- "Why can't I be normal?"

These comments break our hearts.

## Our Fears

Without proper support we fear:
- Jamie will develop mental health problems
- School refusal will become complete
- The academic gap will become insurmountable  
- Jamie's self-esteem will be permanently damaged
- Family breakdown from stress
- Emma's needs being overlooked

## What We Need

1. **Recognition** that Jamie's needs are complex and real
2. **Consistent support** throughout the school day
3. **Specialist teaching** for their learning differences
4. **Therapy support** for sensory and communication needs
5. **Understanding** from education professionals
6. **Hope** that Jamie can reach their potential

## Jamie's Strengths (often overlooked)

- Incredible memory for facts about interests
- Kind and empathetic when regulated
- Creative problem solver
- Fantastic at spotting patterns
- Loyal and honest
- Unique perspective on the world
- Determined when engaged

## Our Vision for Jamie

With the right support, we believe Jamie could:
- Access learning in their own way
- Develop coping strategies for sensory issues
- Build meaningful friendships
- Recognize their own strengths
- Contribute their unique gifts
- Be happy and fulfilled

## Why an EHCP is Essential

Current support isn't working. Despite school's efforts:
- Jamie is falling further behind
- Their mental health is suffering
- Family life is in crisis
- Without change, outcomes look bleak

An EHCP would provide:
- Legal protection for support
- Funding for required help
- Coordination between services
- Hope for the future

## Our Plea

Please see beyond the behaviors to the struggling child underneath. Jamie deserves the chance to learn, grow, and thrive. We cannot watch our bright, unique child disappear into anxiety and failure.

Every child deserves an education that works for them. Jamie's brain works differently, but that doesn't make them less deserving of support. Please help us help our child.

We are not asking for special treatment - we are asking for equal access to education, which Jamie cannot currently achieve without support.

## Final Thoughts

We love Jamie exactly as they are. We don't want to change them - we want to help them navigate a world that wasn't designed for how their brain works. With the right support, Jamie has so much to offer. Without it, we fear for their future.

Please approve this EHCP application. Our child's future depends on it.

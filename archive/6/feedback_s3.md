## Detailed Feedback

### Major Issues (Provision Specificity)
The following provisions are missing at least one of the five mandatory specificity elements (support, provider qualification, staff : student ratio, frequency, duration).  Each row with a missing element is recorded as one **Major** error.

| # | Section | Provision Reference | Missing Element(s) | Why This Is A Problem |
|---|---------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| 1 | Communication & Interaction | Provision #4 – “Visual, oral and written instructions broken into one-step chunks; adult checks for understanding.” | Duration | A legally enforceable provision must state how long it is delivered. Absence of duration means adequacy cannot be judged or monitored. |
| 2 | Cognition & Learning | Provision #5 – “Instructions delivered in short, chunked segments with visual memory aids …” | Duration | Duration missing. Without it, the Local Authority (LA) cannot quantify resource requirements or hold the setting to account. |
| 3 | SEMH | Provision #3 – “Scheduled 1-hour QUAD provision for play, attachment and physical regulation.” | Staff : Student Ratio | The expected staffing level is unknown, making the intensity of support unclear and unenforceable. |
| 4 | SEMH | Provision #4 – “Regular movement/​sensory breaks …” | Frequency, Duration | Both frequency and duration are missing (“Information not available …”). The provision is therefore too vague to ensure the child receives adequate support. |
| 5 | Sensory &/or Physical | Provision #4 – “Access to QUAD physical provision (gross-motor apparatus).” | Staff : Student Ratio | Lack of ratio leaves ambiguity over supervision level and resource allocation. |

### Review of Critical Elements
• File `output_s3.md` exists and follows the required structure (all four areas and three sub-headings per area).
• The "Golden Thread" appears intact: every need has at least one matching provision and each provision links back to an identified need; outcomes align with the listed provisions.
• All outcomes appear SMART – they are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound.

### Required Remediation
1. Populate the missing specificity elements listed above.  Every provision must clearly state ALL of: support, provider qualification, staff : student ratio, frequency, and duration.
2. After amendments, re-check every provision row for completeness to prevent further Major errors.

Correcting the five issues above should allow the file to achieve a PASS on re-validation.

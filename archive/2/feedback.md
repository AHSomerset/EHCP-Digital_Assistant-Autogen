### Detailed Feedback

**Overall Assessment:**
The document adequately meets the validation requirements, with no critical errors. The content is structured correctly and includes the necessary information under all required headings. However, one major issue and one formatting-related minor issue were identified, which should be corrected to ensure the document is fully compliant.

**Critical Issues:**
None.

**Major Issues:**
- MAJOR: The email address for "Parent or Carer 1", Daisy Bailey, contains a typo (`googelmail.com`). This deviation may lead to communication errors.

**Minor Issues:**
- MINOR: The document inconsistently lists some healthcare providers using individual names (e.g., "Charlene Andrewson, Colleen Hathway"), whereas the guidance suggests using practice or department names. For example, it would be more appropriate to list "Anytown Medical Centre" or "Private Occupational Therapy Practice" instead of private providers' personal names.

**Recommendations:**
- Correct the typo in Daisy Bailey's email address to ensure accuracy.
- Revise the naming of healthcare-related professionals to align with the guidance (use department/practice names rather than individuals' names).

### Section 4 - Health Care Needs and Health Care Provision

#### Health Care Needs Which Relate to Their Special Educational Needs
Felicia Bailey, aged 9, exhibits several health care needs that are intrinsically connected to her special educational needs (SEN) and daily functioning:

1. **Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) with a PDA Profile**: Felicia presents significant difficulties in social communication, sensory processing, and anxiety management. These result in heightened anxiety, substantial emotional dysregulation at home following masking behaviors at school, and persistent challenges with educational participation.

2. **Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD)**: She struggles with sensory modulation across multiple domains, including oral fixation, clothing textures, and the environmental stimuli of busy settings such as classrooms and dining halls. These sensory challenges impact her ability to engage in educational tasks and her emotional regulation throughout the school day.

3. **Motor Coordination Needs**: Felicia exhibits dyspraxic traits evidenced by fine and gross motor coordination difficulties. These impairments affect her handwriting, physical balance, and engagement with physical educational activities.

4. **Continence and Toileting**: Felicia has longstanding challenges with nocturnal enuresis, daytime bladder urgency, and constipation due to sensory aversion and fear-based toileting avoidance. Her difficulties in this area significantly impact both her physical comfort and emotional wellbeing while at school.

5. **Sleep Difficulties**: Felicia struggles with sleep initiation and maintenance due to her elevated anxiety levels, often requiring melatonin to support better quality rest. Poor sleep patterns and anxiety-induced nightmares further compound her SEN-related challenges.

6. **Mobility Concerns**: Though walking avoidance has been linked to her PDA profile, she frequently complains of pain in her legs and requires the use of a luggage trolley to travel beyond short distances.

#### Health Care Provision Reasonably Required
To address each need, a detailed provision plan is outlined below:

1. **Support for Autism and Anxiety Regulation**:
   - Provision: Emotional regulation sessions utilizing tools such as Zones of Regulation, social stories, and visual aids.
   - Provider: A skilled teaching assistant trained in autism and PDA management.
   - Frequency: Daily teaching assistant-led regulation support throughout school hours.
   - Duration: Individualized sessions lasting 15–30 minutes, integrated into Felicia’s academic timetable.
   - Ratio: 1:1 personalized support.

2. **Sensory Processing Strategies**:
   - Provision: Access to sensory regulation items (e.g., fidget toys, chewelry, weighted blankets) and a defined quiet space for sensory decompression.
   - Provider: Paediatric Occupational Therapist (OT) and designated school staff.
   - Frequency: Available across all lessons and during lunch/break times.
   - Duration: On-demand sensory breaks lasting ~10 minutes when triggers occur.
   - Ratio: Group work for sensory planning and hyper-specific provisions in a 1:1 ratio during individual occupational therapy sessions.

3. **Motor Skills Improvement**:
   - Provision: Weekly occupational therapy focusing on handwriting, core stability improvement, and motor coordination tasks.
   - Provider: Paediatric Occupational Therapist trained in sensory integration.
   - Frequency: One weekly OT session onsite plus classroom-based interventions led by trained teaching staff.
   - Duration: Weekly sessions last approximately 40 minutes, supplemented by structured classroom strategies.
   - Ratio: 1:1 individual sessions and occasional small-group fine motor skill practices.

4. **Continence Support**:
   - Provision: Scheduled toileting routine integrated using visual aids, with consistent access to urine training techniques (e.g., fluid consumption encouragement).
   - Provider: Continence nurse and trained school staff for implementation.
   - Frequency: Every 1–2 hours based on fluid intake timelines.
   - Duration: 5 minutes per toileting session with continuous monitoring.
   - Ratio: 1:1 tailored support during periodical checks.

5. **Sleep Enhancement Support**:
   - Provision: Implementation of anxiety-reducing bedtime preparation strategies to alleviate nighttime disruptions.
   - Provider: Paediatrician oversight supplemented by CAMHS and parent-led adjustments initiated at home.
   - Frequency: Nightly.
   - Duration: Up to 1 hour relaxation techniques before sleep initiation.
   - Ratio: Family-led.

6. **Mobility Support**:
   - Provision: Referral to and ongoing oversight by physiotherapy services focused on strength-building exercises.
   - Provider: Physiotherapist, supported by mobility aides where necessary.
   - Frequency: Biweekly physiotherapy sessions plus in-school structured movement breaks.
   - Duration: 30–45 minutes per dedicated physiotherapy session.
   - Ratio: 1:1 focus for personalized intervention.

#### Outcomes
Each provision outlined above contributes to specific, measurable, and time-bound outcomes aiming to address the dual impact of health needs and SEN on Felicia’s educational progress:

1. **Improved School Attendance**: Through anxiety regulation strategies and tailored sensory adjustments, Felicia’s attendance rate will be incrementally increased from 63% to at least 80% over the next academic year.
   
2. **Enhanced Emotional Regulation**: Felicia will consistently recognize and utilize sensory and emotional regulation tools to independently manage overwhelm <6 times daily during peak periods within the current academic year.

3. **Motor Coordination Progress**: By end-of-year 3, Felicia will achieve improved fine motor precision, enabling her to comfortably complete handwriting tasks without reporting physical discomfort.

4. **Achieving Continence**: Within 18 months, Felicia will demonstrate progress in achieving daytime continence and a reduced reliance on overnight pull-ups.

5. **Increased Learning Participation**: Felicia will actively participate in small group learning daily and successfully engage for 15–30 minutes in targeted educational tasks by end-of-term 2024.

# Feedback Report: Validation of Section 5 - Social Care

### Overall Assessment: **FAILS**

---

## Critical Errors

1. **Golden Thread Broken**
   - A clear link is missing between the listed needs and their corresponding provisions for the following issues:
     - **Extreme anxiety:** While interventions like sensory strategies and emotional regulation strategies are provided, no H1 provisions are mentioned, and the link between needs and provisions feels incomplete.
     - **Risky behaviors:** This is identified as a need, but no clear specific provision directly addresses safety management in H1 or H2 categories.
   - Outcome ambiguity: Some outcomes (e.g., "Felicia will demonstrate emotional regulation") rely heavily on general strategies but lack clear connection to specific provisions.

2. **Provision Specificity Issues**
   - Some provisions are vague and do not meet the specificity requirements:
     - For example, "Daily structured sensory breaks" lacks detailed information about where, how long, and with whom this is to occur.
     - "Frequent toileting reminders" needs to specify the responsible party and whether it applies to home, school, or both.
   - No explicit identification of the H1 section (provision under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970), which is mentioned as empty.

3. **SMART Outcomes Not Fully Achieved**
   - While some outcomes attempt to be SMART, others fall short:
     - **Specific:** Outcomes like "Felicia will demonstrate emotional regulation" lack concrete mechanisms or criteria for success.
     - **Measurable:** Improvement in "school attendance" is mentioned, but there are no benchmarks or data targets.
     - **Time-bound:** "Over the course of 12 months" is stated, but intermediate measurable milestones (e.g., 3 or 6 months) are omitted.

## Major Errors

1. **H1/H2 Classification**
   - The document declares that no H1 provisions are identified, but it does not explore whether some provisions belong to H1. 
   - It is unclear why critical issues like toileting assistance or risky behavior interventions are omitted from H1.

2. **Structural Issues**
   - While all major headings (Social Care Needs, H1 Social Care Provision, Other (H2) Social Care Provision, Outcomes) are present, the content under these headings (especially H1) is incomplete or unbalanced, making the structure ineffectual.

3. **Relevance to SEND**
   - Almost all listed needs relate directly to SEND or disabilities, such as autism, sensory processing disorder, and motor skill challenges. However, greater clarification is required to justify the absence of certain provisions in the H1 category.

---

## Minor Errors

1. **Wording and Phrasing**
   - The file could use more precise language to enhance clarity and coherence. For example:
     - "Reliance on constant adult supervision" could specify the exact environments where supervision is required (home, school, public settings).

2. **Consistency**
   - Terminologies like "emotional dysregulation" are used without proper elaboration on specific strategies apart from general mentions like "visual aids."

### Recommendations

- **Address Critical Gaps:**
  - Link **every stated need** to a provision (H1 or H2) and ensure outcomes connect logically to these provisions.
  - Provide specific and empowered details for all provisions (e.g., frequency, duration, and responsible party).
  - Make all stated outcomes fully SMART.

- **Revise Major Errors:**
  - Reassess the classification of provisions into H1 and H2 categories.
  - Ensure the file balances content across all headings, especially the currently sparse H1 section.

- **Enhance Clarity:**
  - Refine phrasing to ensure that terms and strategies are comprehensively described.
  - Consistently use precise language and structured formatting for easier validation and understanding.

### Final Judgment: **FAILS**
The document requires substantial revisions to comply with the validation guidance, prioritizing the resolution of critical issues in the Golden Thread, Provision Specificity, and SMART criteria.

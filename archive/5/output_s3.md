---

#### **Communication and Interaction**

**Identified Special Educational Need(s):**  
Felicia Bailey has been identified with Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC), including a Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) profile. She experiences significant difficulties with social communication and interaction. She often struggles to articulate her needs, relies on adults to notice non-verbal cues such as playing with her hands or head down, and requires problem-solving support from trusted individuals. Felicia is literal in her interpretation and can misinterpret jokes or conversations, leading to confusion and anxiety. Masking behaviors exacerbate her challenges, with emotional dysregulation manifesting as physical outbursts at home.

**Provision Relating to That Need:**  
1. **Support required:** Social communication interventions focusing on pragmatics, understanding jokes, and appropriate verbal/non-verbal responses. Use of TEACHH tools and visuals to support language and comprehension.  
2. **Who will provide it:** Speech and Language Therapist (experienced with autism and PDA) for direct intervention; co-support by Teaching Assistant.  
3. **Staff/student ratio:** 1:1 support during interventions.  
4. **How often:** Weekly individual sessions; daily structured interactions supervised by the Teaching Assistant.  
5. **How long for:** 45-minute therapy sessions; scalable daily interactions throughout the school day.  

**Intended Outcomes:**  
- Felicia will be able to articulate her needs and emotions using structured tools like Zones of Regulation, emotion stones, or traffic light cards by the end of Key Stage 2.  
- She will demonstrate improved social understanding, enabling her to build two meaningful friendships by the end of the academic year.

Anxiety impacts her ability to concentrate in noisy environments, affecting her engagement and progress.

**Provision Relating to That Need:**

2. **Who will provide it:** Specialist teacher experienced in dyslexia and executive functioning needs, supported by a Teaching Assistant.  
3. **Staff/student ratio:** Small group sessions with a maximum of 4 students; 1:1 support for structured learning tasks.  
4. **How often:** Daily phonics group sessions; 20-minute targeted interventions weekly for executive functioning skills.  
5. **How long for:** Phonics sessions lasting 30 minutes each; executive functioning sessions lasting 20 minutes weekly.  

**Intended Outcomes:**  
- By the end of this academic year, Felicia will consistently recall multi-step instructions during class tasks.  
- Felicia will individually complete simple writing assignments using phonetic strategies and visual tools within 6 months.

#### **Sensory and/or Physical Needs**

**Identified Special Educational Need(s):**  
Felicia has sensory processing challenges related to noise, smells, and textures. Her proprioceptive needs include seeking movement-based regulation activities. Physical difficulties involve poor fine/gross motor skills, balance, and fatigue when walking or sitting for prolonged periods.

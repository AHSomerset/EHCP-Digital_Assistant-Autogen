### Social Care Needs and Social Care Provision

#### Social Care Needs
Felicia Bailey has several social care needs relating to her special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), which include Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) with a pathological demand avoidant profile (PDA), sensory processing difficulties (SPD), suspected ADHD, and fine and gross motor challenges. These needs manifest as:

1. Extreme anxiety surrounding perceived demands, transitions, and social interactions, affecting her daily activities, ability to attend school, and overall emotional wellbeing.
2. Sensory aversions to noise, smells, textures, and crowded environments, which make school and other public settings overwhelming for her.
3. Persistent difficulties with toileting and continence management, including daytime wetting and nighttime enuresis, accompanied by a fear of using unfamiliar toilets.
4. Risky behaviors, such as climbing out of windows and attempting to run into roads, posing safety concerns.
5. Emotional dysregulation, with regular meltdowns and aggressive outbursts (kicking, biting, throwing items).
6. Reliance on constant adult supervision both at home and in educational settings, particularly during activities requiring self-regulation or communication.

Felicia’s needs significantly impact her family, with her older sister, Dianne, often being subjected to aggressive behaviors and requiring support through Young Carers. The family’s home has undergone safety modifications such as locks on windows and doors to mitigate risks arising from Felicia's behavior.

#### H1 Social Care Provision
No provisions under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 (H1) have been explicitly identified in the source documents as currently being provided or required for Felicia Bailey. Consequently, this section is marked as follows:

**No provision identified.**

#### Other (H2) Social Care Provision
Felicia’s SEND necessitates provisions to address her unique needs within the home and educational environments. The following provisions are reasonably required:

1. **Support Required:** 
   - Continence training to aid Felicia in managing daytime wetting and nighttime enuresis.
   - Sensory strategies to reduce triggers in noisy and crowded environments, including access to quieter spaces and sensory regulation tools.
   - Structured movement breaks tailored to her proprioceptive needs to enhance physical regulation.
   - Emotional regulation strategies that include regular check-ins with adults and visual aids to support her ability to express feelings.
   - Assistance in developing independence in personal hygiene, including toileting and handwashing.
   - Behavior management strategies at home to mitigate emotionally dysregulated outbursts and foster co-regulation.

2. **Who Will Provide It:** 
   - Qualified occupational therapists trained in ASD and sensory integration therapy.
   - Educational support staff (e.g., SEND specialist teaching assistants) experienced in working with children with complex SEND.
   - Continence team professionals for toileting and fluid intake guidance.
   - Mental health professionals from CAMHS for therapeutic interventions such as parent-assisted CBT.

3. **Staff/Student Ratio:** 
   - A small group learning environment with a staff-student ratio of 1:1 or 2:1 in educational and therapy settings.

4. **How Often:** 
   - Daily structured sensory breaks.
   - Weekly specialized occupational therapy sessions.
   - Frequent toileting reminders (approximately every 1–2 hours) facilitated by adults at school.
   - Daily or as-needed emotional regulation check-ins during school and home routines.

5. **How Long For:** 
   - Sensory breaks lasting 5–10 minutes per session.
   - Occupational therapy sessions lasting 40 minutes weekly.
   - Fluid intake and toileting check-ins integrated into regular daily routines.

#### Outcomes
The provisions detailed above aim to achieve the following outcomes for Felicia Bailey:

1. **Specific:** Felicia will learn and implement strategies to regulate her emotions independently in both home and school environments.
2. **Measurable:** Felicia’s school attendance will improve consistently, with successful transitions into the classroom and sustained engagement throughout the school day.
3. **Achievable:** With appropriate support, Felicia will complete movement breaks and sensory activities with minimal guidance from adults.
4. **Relevant:** Felicia will develop self-awareness regarding her toileting needs and actively participate in continence routines.
5. **Time-bound:** Felicia will demonstrate emotional regulation, continence management, and improved coping behaviors over the course of 12 months, with biannual reviews to assess progress.

Through personalized and targeted H2 provisions, Felicia’s emotional, sensory, physical, and social care needs can be systematically addressed, fostering a safer and more supportive environment that enables her to thrive academically, socially, and emotionally.

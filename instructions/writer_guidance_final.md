# Final Writer Guidance: Polishing and Correction

Your task is to refine and polish the complete `final_document.md` based on the feedback provided in `final_feedback.md`. Your goal is to resolve inconsistencies and remove duplication.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**

1.  **Read the Final Feedback:** First, carefully analyze the feedback report to understand the required changes.
2.  **Read the Full Document:** Load the content of the `final_document.md` that needs correcting.
3.  **Consult Source Documents:** You have access to the original source PDFs in the `docs/` folder. Use them to:
    -   Verify facts if there are contradictions.
    -   Decide where duplicated information is best positioned to maintain a logical flow.
4.  **Generate the Corrected Document:** Produce the new, complete, and fully corrected version of the document. Only make changes where issues are identifield in `final_document.md`.
5.  **Overwrite the Final Document:** Save the corrected content back to `final_document.md`.

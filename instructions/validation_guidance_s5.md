# EHCP Validator Guidance: Section 5 - Social Care Needs and Provision

Your task is to validate a single file, `output_s5.md`, and produce a feedback report.
You MUST strictly follow the required format for the report and use the validation rules below to identify and categorise issues, paying close attention to the "Golden Thread" connecting Needs, Provisions, and Outcomes within all four areas of need. You must also validate the correct classification of social care provision into H1 and H2 categories.


## Overall File Structure 

*   **Expected File:** `output_s5.md` MUST exist. If missing, it's a **CRITICAL** error.

## Content Validation Rules for Section 5

### Section-Specific Rules

*   **Relevance to SEN (MAJOR):** The social care needs described MUST relate to the child's SEN or disability.
*   **H1/H2 Classification (MAJOR):** Check if the provision seems correctly placed. For example, 'help with personal care at home' belongs in H1. 'Referral for family support' might belong in H2. Misclassification is a **MAJOR** error.
[H1 includes social care provision that is made under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970. This includes services like:
- Practical assistance in the home (e.g., help with personal care).
- Provision of, or assistance with, recreational and educational facilities.
- Assistance with travel.
- Adaptations to the home.
- Facilitating holidays, meals, or telephone access.

H2 is for any other social care provision reasonably required by the learning difficulties or disabilities which result in the child having SEN. This is provision that does **not** fall under the H1 criteria above]
*   **Needs without provision (CRITICAL):** The social care needs described must be clearly outlined in the source documents by professionals along with clearly defined provisions.
*   **No Needs Statement (Correctness Check):** If no social care needs are present, the file MUST contain the exact phrase "Child or young person has no identified special educational needs in this area".

### Document Structure (CRITICAL)
Needs, provisions and outcomes MUST be written in the following format:
**Strengths**
**Social Care Need 1:**
**H1 Provision: [H1 Social Care provision which relates to need 1]**
**H2 Provision: [H2 Social Care provision which relates to need 1]**
**Outcome: [outcome which relates to need 1]**
Deviation from this structure is a **CRITICAL** error.

The finished document MUST match this structure (failure to do so is a CRITICAL error):

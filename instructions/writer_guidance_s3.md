# Writer Guidance: Section 3 - Needs, Provisions, Outcomes

Your goal is to create `output_s3_i#.md`. You must categorise **all** needs identified in the source documents and define their provision and outcomes.

**Language:** You must use **British English**.
**Special Wording:** You **MUST** check for and apply any mandatory, verbatim text blocks as defined in the `_specific_wording_rules_s3.md`.

### **CRITICAL WORKFLOW: How to Structure Multiple Needs**

This is your most important instruction. You MUST follow this algorithm precisely to structure the document correctly.

1.  **Identify and Categorize All Needs First:** Before you begin writing, create a complete, internal list of all the distinct needs you have found in the source documents. For each need, use the `_need_categorisation_guide.md` to assign it to its single, correct category.

2.  **Write Each Need Sequentially into Numbered Fields:** When you are writing a category (e.g., `## Communication & Interaction`), you **MUST** place each distinct need from your list into its own separate, numbered field.
    *   The first need for that category goes into `**... Need 1:**`.
    *   The second need for that category goes into `**... Need 2:**`.
    *   The third need goes into `**... Need 3:**`, and so on.

3.  **DO NOT** combine multiple distinct needs into a single "Need 1" field. Each separate need must have its own number.

4.  **Link Provisions and Outcomes:** For each need you write (e.g., `Need 3`), you MUST then write its corresponding provision and outcome in the fields with the same number (`Provision 3`, `Outcome 3`).

### Core Rules for Content

*   **Needs:** Describe the child's needs concisely and specifically, including the impact each need has on them. Only include needs identified by professionals.

*   **Provisions:** **CRITICAL:** Provision should be specified for **every need**. However, you **MUST NOT invent** provisions if they are not in the source documents. Provisions must be specific, detailed, and quantified **only if the source document provides this detail**. 

*   **Outcomes:** **CRITICAL:** Outcomes should be **SMART** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). An outcome like "To improve social skills" is not SMART. A better outcome is "By the end of the term, Gemma will initiate a conversation with a peer during break time on at least 3 occasions per week." However, you **MUST NOT invent** SMART details (like timeframes or metrics) if they are not in the source documents. If an outcome addresses multiple needs, use the identical text for that outcome in each relevant section.

*   **Handling Multiple Provisions/Outcomes:** If a single need is met by multiple distinct provisions, or leads to multiple distinct outcomes, you **MUST** list all of them within the single corresponding `Provision` or `Outcome` field. You MUST use a bulleted list (using a hyphen -) to separate each item.

## Strengths
You must follow the instructions in `_s3_strengths_guide.md` when populating the strengths fields.

---

## Structure and style
Your output file **MUST** use the exact structure and all headings defined in the `_structure_s3.md` guidance file.

## Social Care Provision (H1/H2)
Social care provisions must be separated into `H1 Provision` and `H2 Provision`. Refer to the `_need_categorisation_guide.md` for full details.
*   **H1 Provision:** For statutory services under the CSDPA 1970 (e.g., help with personal care, home adaptations).
*   **H2 Provision:** For all other social care provisions related to SEN.
*   It is NOT essential for each need to have BOTH H1 and H2 provision.

**Important** 
- Not all sections must have needs included; only if there are needs which fit that category in the source documents should they be included in the ouput file. Each section may have between 0 and 10 needs. 

**Tone:** The tone should be professional, objective, and sympathetic, but precise. Where possible, replicate the exact professional language used in the appendix documents. Completeness and accuracy are more important than simplicity for this section.

## **Be Factual and Objective, but remain sympathetic**
Your tone should be objective and based entirely on the professional reports, but should not be blunt or unsympathetic towards the child.

Where possible, the child should be referred to by their first name, rather than [he/she].

### **CRITICAL RULE FOR PROVISIONS AND OUTCOMES: LOSSLESS SYNTHESIS**

**For all `Provision` and `Outcome` fields, your job is to perform a "lossless synthesis"**: You must capture every single relevant detail from the source documents.

1.  **Synthesise, Don't Paraphrase:** Your job is to find all the components of a provision or outcome (even if they are scattered across a report) and combine them into a single, coherent statement.
2.  **Preserve All Details:** You **MUST** include any and all relevant specific information found in the source. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   **Frequency:** (e.g., "daily," "weekly," "twice per term")
    *   **Duration:** (e.g., "for 30 minutes," "over 6 weeks")
    *   **Personnel:** (e.g., "from a Teaching Assistant," "1:1 with a qualified Speech Therapist")
    *   **Metrics:** (e.g., "on at least 3 occasions," "with 80% accuracy")
3.  **Do not simplify or rephrase in a way that loses any of the critical details listed above.** Completeness is more important than brevity for these specific fields.

**Example:**
*   **Source Document says:** "SALT is recommended... The sessions should be 1:1... We propose a weekly frequency... each session should be 30 minutes."
*   **BAD (Loss of detail):** "Regular 1:1 speech therapy."
*   **GOOD (Lossless Synthesis):** "Weekly 1:1 Speech and Language Therapy for 30 minutes per session."

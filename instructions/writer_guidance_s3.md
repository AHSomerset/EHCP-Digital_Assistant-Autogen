# EHCP Writer Guidance: Section 3 - Needs, Provisions and Outcomes

## Your Current Goal

Your sole focus for this task is to create **one single output file**.

This file covers all four areas of special educational need, as well as health care needs and social care needs. For each area, you must detail the **Needs**, the specific **Provision** to meet those needs, and the **Outcomes** that the provision aims to achieve. Follow the detailed structure and rules below precisely.

---

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOCUMENT GENERATION

**ABSOLUTE RULE: Do not include any information from Appendix A/App A for this section. This should not include any parent views.**

## Required Output File for This Stage

You must create **only one file** in this stage:

*   **Filename to create:** `output_s3_i#.md`
*   **`section_name` parameter to use:** `"Needs, Provisions and Outcomes"`

---

## Specific content guidelines Social Care Provisions:

**Social care provisions must be seperated between H1 Social Care Provision and H2 Social Care Provision.**
**It is NOT essential for each need to have BOTH H1 and H2 provision. Some needs may only have provision under one cateogry (H1 or H2).**

### H1 Social Care Provision
[This section is for any social care provision that is made under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970. This includes services like:
- Practical assistance in the home (e.g., help with personal care).
- Provision of, or assistance with, recreational and educational facilities.
- Assistance with travel.
- Adaptations to the home.
- Facilitating holidays, meals, or telephone access.]

### Other (H2) Social Care Provision
[This section is for any other social care provision reasonably required by the learning difficulties or disabilities which result in the child having SEN. This is provision that does **not** fall under the H1 criteria above.] 


## Section 3: Content and Structure Template

The file `output_s3.md` must be structured under the following six main areas of need. Needs should be categorised strictly according to the _need_categoristion_guide. 

### Needs, Provisions and Outcomes

*   ### Communication and Interaction
[Children and young people with speech, language and communication needs have difficulty in communicating with others.]

*   ### Cognition and Learning
[Support for learning difficulties may be required when children and young people learn at a slower pace than their peers, even with appropriate differentiation.]

*   ### Social, Emotional and Mental Health Difficulties
[Children and young people may experience a wide range of social, emotional and mental health difficulties which manifest themselves in many ways.]

*   ### Sensory and/or Physical Needs
[Some children and young people require special educational provision because they have a disability which prevents or hinders them from making use of the educational facilities generally provided.]

*   ### Health Care Needs
[This section is for needs that require provision from a health professional.]

*   ### Social Care Needs
[This section is for needs that require provision from social care services or support for the family.]

### Output style guide
All content must be written in accessible languge, using plain english. Where possible, needs, provision and outcomes descriptions should borrow the language used by the professionals in the source documents. Descriptions of need should be concise, but not too concise as to lose some of the important info included in the description in the source documents.

When describing needs, it is important to avoid blunt statements - decriptions must be factual, but written in a way which is sympathetic to the child.

# EHCP Writer Guidance: Section 3 - Special Educational Needs and Provision

## Your Current Goal

Your sole focus for this task is to create **one single, comprehensive file**: `output_s3.md`.

This file covers all four areas of special educational need. For each area, you must detail the **Needs**, the specific **Provision** to meet those needs, and the **Outcomes** that the provision aims to achieve. Follow the detailed structure and rules below precisely.

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOCUMENT GENERATION

### ANTI-HALLUCINATION REQUIREMENTS

**ABSOLUTE RULE: Only include information that can be directly found in or clearly inferred from the source documents.**
**ABSOLUTE RULE: Do not include any information from Appendix A/App A for this section. This should not include any parent views.**

1.  **NO FABRICATION:** Never create fictional information. This includes needs, provisions, or outcomes not present in the source material.
2.  **MISSING INFORMATION:** If specific information required by the template is not available in the source documents, you MUST leave the section blank. Do not write: "Information not available in source documents". Do NOT invent content to fill gaps.
3.  **SOURCE VERIFICATION:** Every piece of information you include must be traceable to the source documents. For example, do not invent staff-to-student ratios or frequencies for provisions if they are not specified in the reports.

## Required Output File for This Stage

You must create **only one file** in this stage. Use the `save_document_section` tool with the following parameters:

*   **Filename to create:** `output_s3.md`
*   **`section_name` parameter to use:** `"Special Educational Needs and Provision"`

### Important File Management Rules

*   **One File Only:** Do not create any other files. Your only task is to create the single, consolidated Section 3 file.
*   **Correct Naming:** Use the exact `section_name` "Special Educational Needs and Provision" in the tool.
*   **Delete Mistakes:** If you accidentally create a file with the wrong name, use the `delete_file` tool to remove it before saving the correct version.

## Section 3: Content and Structure Template

The file `output_s3.md` must be structured with the following four main areas of need. 

*   ### Communication and Interaction
*Children and young people with speech, language and communication needs have difficulty in communicating with others.*

*   ### Cognition and Learning
*Support for learning difficulties may be required when children and young people learn at a slower pace than their peers, even with appropriate differentiation.*

*   ### Social, Emotional and Mental Health Difficulties
*Children and young people may experience a wide range of social, emotional and mental health difficulties which manifest themselves in many ways.*

*   ### Sensory and/or Physical Needs
*Some children and young people require special educational provision because they have a disability which prevents or hinders them from making use of the educational facilities generally provided.*

[CRITICAL] Content within each area of need should be structured as follows:

**Strengths** [any strengths which are identified under the area of need]

**Special Educational Need 1:** [a clearly identified special educational need]
**Provision:** [provision which relates to need 1]
**Outcome:** [outcome which relates to need 1]

**Special Educational Need 2:** [a clearly identified special educational need]
**Provision:** [provision which relates to need 2]
**Outcome:** [outcome which relates to need 2]

**Special Education Need 3:** [a clearly identified special educational need]
................

## Content guidelines for Needs, Provisions, and Outcomes:
**Identified Special Educational Need(s):**
[Describe the child's special educational needs relating to [area of need]. It is a legal requirement to list all identified needs. Each need should be concise and specific. Briefly describe the impact the needs are having on the child to maintain the "golden thread" between need, provision, and outcome. If there are no needs in this category, you must enter: ‘Child/young person has no identified special educational needs in this area’. Only include needs which are clearly identified by professionals]

**Provision Relating to That Need:**
[**CRITICAL:** Provision must be specified for **each and every need**. The provision must be specific, detailed, and quantified. Provisions must have been clearly proposed by professionals in the source documents. Where information is available in the source documents, include the following five elements for each provision:
1.  Support required: What specific support or intervention is needed.
2.  Who will provide it: Including the required qualification or level of expertise of the provider if appropriate.
3.  Staff/student ratio: e.g., 1:1, 2:1, or 6:1 group work (if appropriate).
4.  How often: The frequency, e.g., daily, weekly, termly.
5.  How long for: The duration for each session, e.g., hours or minutes.
Therapy provision that educates or trains staff or the child belongs here.]
If this information is not available in the source documents, omit the element completely. Example: do NOT state 'Staff student ratio: Not specified in source'.


**Outcome:**
[**CRITICAL:** All outcomes must be **SMART** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). The outcome should be personal and clearly linked to the provision. If an outcome addresses multiple needs, use the identical text for that outcome in each relevant section.]

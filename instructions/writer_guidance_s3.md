## Section 3: Content and Structure Template

The file `output_s3.md` must be structured with the following four main areas of need. 

### Special Educational Needs and Provision

*   ### Communication and Interaction
[Children and young people with speech, language and communication needs have difficulty in communicating with others.]

*   ### Cognition and Learning
[Support for learning difficulties may be required when children and young people learn at a slower pace than their peers, even with appropriate differentiation.]

*   ### Social, Emotional and Mental Health Difficulties
[Children and young people may experience a wide range of social, emotional and mental health difficulties which manifest themselves in many ways.]

*   ### Sensory and/or Physical Needs
[Some children and young people require special educational provision because they have a disability which prevents or hinders them from making use of the educational facilities generally provided.]

[CRITICAL] The output must be structured exactly as follows:

# Writer Guidance: Section 3 - Needs, Provisions, Outcomes

Your goal is to create `output_s3_i#.md`. You must categorise all needs identified in the source documents and define their provision and outcomes.

**CRITICAL RULE: Do not include any information from Appendix A (parent/carer views) for this section.**

## Core Rules for Needs, Provisions, and Outcomes

*   **Needs:** Describe the child's needs concisely and specifically, including the impact the need has on them. If a category has no needs, you MUST write `[Child's name] has no identified special educational needs in this area` in the `Need 1` field and leave the rest blank for that category. Only include needs clearly identified by professionals.

*   **Provisions:** **CRITICAL:** Provision should be specified for **every need**. However, you **MUST NOT invent** provisions if they are not in the source documents. Provisions must be specific, detailed, and quantified **only if the source document provides this detail**. A fully specified provision includes:
    1.  The support required.
    2.  Who will provide it.
    3.  Staff/student ratio (e.g., 1:1).
    4.  Frequency (e.g., weekly).
    5.  Duration (e.g., 30 minutes).

*   **Outcomes:** **CRITICAL:** Outcomes should be **SMART** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). An outcome like "To improve social skills" is not SMART. A better outcome is "By the end of the term, Gemma will initiate a conversation with a peer during break time on at least 3 occasions per week." However, you **MUST NOT invent** SMART details (like timeframes or metrics) if they are not in the source documents. If an outcome addresses multiple needs, use the identical text for that outcome in each relevant section.

## Structure
Your output file **MUST** use the exact structure and all headings defined in the `_structure_s3.md` guidance file.

## Social Care Provision (H1/H2)
Social care provisions must be separated into `H1 Provision` and `H2 Provision`. Refer to the `_need_categorisation_guide.md` for full details.
*   **H1 Provision:** For statutory services under the CSDPA 1970 (e.g., help with personal care, home adaptations).
*   **H2 Provision:** For all other social care provisions related to SEN.
*   It is NOT essential for each need to have BOTH H1 and H2 provision.


### Syle guide
You must use accessible languge and plain english. Where possible, borrow the language used by the professionals in the source documents. Descriptions of need should be concise, but contain all important information as included in the source document.

Avoid blunt statements when describing needs. Be factual, but sympathetic to the child.

**Important** 
- Not all sections must have needs included. Only if there are needs which fit that category in the source documents should they be included in the ouput file. Each section may have between 0 and 10 needs. All special educational needs identified in the source documents should appear in the output file.


*   **Handling Multiple Provisions/Outcomes:** If a single need is met by multiple distinct provisions, or leads to multiple distinct outcomes, you **MUST** list all of them within the single corresponding `Provision` or `Outcome` field. You **MUST** use a bulleted list (using a hyphen `-`) to separate each item.

### Provision Specificity Rules

#### Definition of a Specific Provision
A fully specified and quantified provision is the gold standard. It should contain the following five elements where applicable:
1.  **Support required:** What specific support or intervention is needed.
2.  **Who will provide it:** The required qualification or level of expertise of the provider.
3.  **Staff/student ratio:** e.g., 1:1, 2:1, or small group work.
4.  **Frequency:** How often the support is provided (e.g., daily, weekly, termly).
5.  **Duration:** How long each session will last (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour).

#### Rules for the Fact-Checker

You must use the definition above to validate the provisions in the draft against the source documents with the following logic:

1.  **Check for Hallucination (CRITICAL Error):** For every provision, compare the draft to the source text. If the writer has added **any** specific, quantifiable detail (like a ratio, frequency, or duration) that was **NOT** explicitly stated in the source documents, this is a **CRITICAL** hallucination error.

2.  **Check for Omission (MINOR Error):** **Only if** no hallucination is found, check the reverse. If the source documents **DID** contain a specific detail (like a ratio, frequency, or duration) but the writer **failed to include it** in the draft, this is a **MINOR** error.

3.  **Check for Vagueness (NOT an Error):** If a provision in the draft is vague (e.g., "regular support from a TA") because the source text itself was vague, the writer has acted correctly. This is **NOT an error** and should not be flagged.

### Provision Specificity
Vague or unspecified provision is a **Minor** error. For EVERY provision listed, you must check if it contains the following five elements:
1.  **Support required** (What is it?)
2.  **Provider qualification** (Who provides it?)
3.  **Staff/student ratio** (e.g., 1:1)
4.  **Frequency** (How often?)
5.  **Duration** (For how long?)
*   A provision missing any of these key details (e.g., "regular support from a TA") is not specific enough and constitutes a **Minor** error.

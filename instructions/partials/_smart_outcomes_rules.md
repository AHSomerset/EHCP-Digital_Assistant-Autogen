### SMART Outcomes (Major)
Outcomes that are not SMART are a **Major** error. For EVERY outcome, check if it is:
*   **S**pecific (Clear and well-defined)
*   **M**easurable (Progress can be tracked)
*   **A**chievable (Realistic)
*   **R**elevant (Appropriate for the child)
*   **T**ime-bound (Has a timeframe)
*   An outcome like "To improve social skills" is not SMART. A SMART outcome would be: "By the end of the term, X will initiate a conversation with a peer during unstructured break time on at least 3 occasions per week."

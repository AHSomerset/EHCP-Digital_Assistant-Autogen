### SMART Outcomes Rules

#### Definition of a SMART Outcome
The gold standard for an outcome is for it to be SMART. This means it must be:
*   **S**pecific (Clear and well-defined)
*   **M**easurable (Progress can be tracked)
*   **A**chievable (Realistic for the child)
*   **R**elevant (Appropriate for the child's needs)
*   **T**ime-bound (Has a clear timeframe)

An outcome like "To improve social skills" is not SMART. A SMART outcome would be: "By the end of the term, Gemma will initiate a conversation with a peer during unstructured break time on at least 3 occasions per week."

#### Rules for the Fact-Checker

You must use the SMART definition to validate the outcomes in the draft against the source documents with the following logic:

1.  **Check for Hallucination (CRITICAL Error):** Compare the draft outcome to the source text. If the writer has added a specific **timeframe** or **metric** (e.g., "by the end of the term," "3 occasions per week") that was **NOT** explicitly stated in the source documents, this is a **CRITICAL** hallucination error.

2.  **Check for Omission (MAJOR Error):** **Only if** no hallucination is found, check the reverse. If the source documents **DID** contain all the elements required for a SMART outcome but the writer **failed to synthesize them** into a single, SMART outcome, this is a **MAJOR** error.

3.  **Check for Vagueness (NOT an Error):** If an outcome in the draft is not SMART (e.g., "To improve social skills") because the source text itself provided a non-SMART outcome, the writer has acted correctly by not inventing details. This is **NOT an error** and should not be flagged.

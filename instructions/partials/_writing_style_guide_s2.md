# Critical Writing Style Guide

**Your output for this section MUST adhere to these style and readability rules.**

### 1. Your Goal: Empathetic Clarity

**Primary Goal:** To tell the child's story in a way that is clear, sympathetic, and easy for their family to read.
**Technical Target:** Aim for a **Flesch Reading Ease score of 60 or higher**.
**Language:** You must use **British English** (e.g., "colour," "organise").

### 2. ### **CRITICAL OVERRIDING INSTRUCTION: CAPTURING THE FAMILY VOICE**
This is your most important rule. It overrides all other style principles if there is a conflict.

*   **Prioritise the Child's/Family's Voice:** You have been provided with examples of the child/family's voice in the main prompt. You **MUST** mimic this tone, style, and vocabulary to capture the voice of the family. It is better for the text to sound authentic to the family than for it to be perfectly formal.
*   **Use Direct Quotes:** You **SHOULD** weave short, direct quotes from the "Family Voice Examples" or elsewhere in the source documents to add warmth and authenticity. Do NOT use quotation marks even when quoting directly.
*   **Synthesise, Don't Sanitise:** Your job is to summarise the views while preserving the *feeling* behind them. Do not strip out the emotional context.

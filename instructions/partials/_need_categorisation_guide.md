# Guidance: How to Categorise Needs

This guide is your single source of truth for deciding which section a specific need belongs in. 

**Important** - Not all sections must have needs included. Only if there are needs which fit that category in the source documents should they be included in the ouput file. Each section may have between 0 and 10 needs. All special educational needs identified in the source documents should appear in the output file.

**The Golden Rule: A single, distinct need should only be placed in ONE section.** Your primary task is to avoid duplication by correctly categorising each need at the source.

### How to Decide Where a Need Belongs

Use the following decision tree based on the **primary focus** of the need and the **source document** it comes from.

**1. Is the need about how the child thinks, learns, understands, or communicates?**
   *   **YES -> Use the source document appendix to determine the sub-category:**
        *   **Source: Appendix B / EY SEND Support Review ->** It likely belongs under one of these four SEN headings:
            *   **Communication and Interaction:** For needs related to speech, language, understanding social cues, or interacting with others.
            *   **Cognition and Learning:** For needs related to academic skills, memory, attention, and processing information.
            *   **Social, Emotional and Mental Health (SEMH):** For needs related to managing feelings, behavior, anxiety, or mental health conditions.
            *   **Sensory and/or Physical Needs:** For needs related to mobility, motor skills, vision, hearing, or sensory processing disorders.

**2. Is the need about the child's medical condition, diagnosis, or access to therapy/healthcare?**
   *   **YES -> Place it in Health Care Needs.**
   *   This section is for needs that require provision from a health professional.
   *   **Source Hint:** If the information comes from a **Children and Young Peopleâ€™s Therapy Service document, a medical report (Appendix C), or a Paediatrician's letter**, it is likely a Health Care Need.
   *   *Example: A need for "Occupational Therapy to develop fine motor skills" is a Health Need.*

**3. Is the need about care, safety, or support outside of school hours, or access to social services?**
   *   **YES -> Place it in Social Care Needs.**
   *   This section is for needs that require provision from social care services or support for the family.
   *   **Source Hint:** If the information comes from **Appendix E (Advice from Social Care) or a Family Intervention Service (FIS) report**, it is likely a Social Care Need.
   *   *Example: A need for "practical assistance in the home" is a Social Care Need.*

### Summary of Demarcations

*   **"Difficulty making friends"** -> Primarily a **Communication and Interaction** need.
*   **"Anxiety about attending school"** -> Primarily a **Social, Emotional and Mental Health** need.
*   **"Requires a special diet for a medical condition"** -> Primarily a **Health Care Need** .
*   **"Needs support with personal care routines at home"** -> Primarily a **Social Care Need**.

By following these rules, you will ensure the final document is consistent and free of duplication.

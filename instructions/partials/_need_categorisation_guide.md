# Guidance: How to Categorise Needs

This guide is your single source of truth for deciding which section a specific need belongs in.

**The Golden Rule: A single, distinct need should only be placed in ONE section.** Your primary task is to avoid duplication by correctly categorising each need at the source.

### How to Decide Where a Need Belongs

Use the following decision tree based on the **primary focus** of the need and the **source document** it comes from.

**1. Is the need about how the child thinks, learns, understands, or communicates?**
   *   **YES -> Place it in Section 3 (Special Educational Needs).**
   *   Use the source document appendix to determine the sub-category:
        *   **Source: Appendix B / EY SEND Support Review ->** It likely belongs under one of these four SEN headings:
            *   **Communication and Interaction:** For needs related to speech, language, understanding social cues, or interacting with others.
            *   **Cognition and Learning:** For needs related to academic skills, memory, attention, and processing information.
            *   **Social, Emotional and Mental Health (SEMH):** For needs related to managing feelings, behavior, anxiety, or mental health conditions.
            *   **Sensory and/or Physical Needs:** For needs related to mobility, motor skills, vision, hearing, or sensory processing disorders.

**2. Is the need about the child's medical condition, diagnosis, or access to therapy/healthcare?**
   *   **YES -> Place it in Section 4 (Health Care Needs).**
   *   This section is for needs that require provision from a health professional.
   *   **Source Hint:** If the information comes from a **Children and Young Peopleâ€™s Therapy Service document, a medical report (Appendix C), or a Paediatrician's letter**, it is likely a Health Care Need.
   *   *Example: A need for "Occupational Therapy to develop fine motor skills" is a Health Need.*

**3. Is the need about care, safety, or support outside of school hours, or access to social services?**
   *   **YES -> Place it in Section 5 (Social Care Needs).**
   *   This section is for needs that require provision from social care services or support for the family.
   *   **Source Hint:** If the information comes from **Appendix E (Advice from Social Care) or a Family Intervention Service (FIS) report**, it is likely a Social Care Need.
   *   *Example: A need for "practical assistance in the home" is a Social Care Need.*

### Summary of Demarcations

*   **"Difficulty making friends"** -> Primarily a **Communication and Interaction** need (Section 3).
*   **"Anxiety about attending school"** -> Primarily a **Social, Emotional and Mental Health** need (Section 3).
*   **"Requires a special diet for a medical condition"** -> Primarily a **Health Care Need** (Section 4).
*   **"Needs support with personal care routines at home"** -> Primarily a **Social Care Need** (Section 5).

By following these rules, you will ensure the final document is consistent and free of duplication.

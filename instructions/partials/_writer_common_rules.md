## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOCUMENT GENERATION

### CORE PRINCIPLE 1: STRICT ADHERENCE TO STRUCTURE
**ABSOLUTE RULE: EVEN IF A FIELD CONTAINS NO INFO, THE FIELD HEADING MUST REMAIN IN THE OUTPUT. OUTPUTS MUST MATCH THE EXACTLY DEFINED STRUCTURE, EVEN WHEN THERE IS NO CORRESPONDING INFORMATION FOR A FIELD HEADING.**

---

### CORE PRINCIPLE 2: ANTI-HALLUCINATION AND FACTUAL ACCURACY

**ABSOLUTE RULE: Only include information that is directly stated in the source documents. If the information is not present, the field MUST be left blank.**

1.  **NO FABRICATION:** Never invent information. This includes names, dates, activities, aspirations, and especially **durations, frequencies, or quantities for provisions and outcomes.**
2.  **EXAMPLE OF FABRICATION (DO NOT DO THIS):**
    *   If the source says "Gemma will receive speech therapy," **DO NOT** write "Gemma will receive weekly speech therapy for 30 minutes." You have invented the frequency and duration.
3.  **EXAMPLE OF ACCURACY (DO THIS):**
    *   If the source only says "Gemma will receive speech therapy," you **MUST** write only "Gemma will receive speech therapy."
4.  **MISSING INFORMATION:** If information for a required field is not available, you **MUST** leave the field blank.
    *   Do NOT invent content to fill gaps.
    *   Do NOT write "Information not available" or "Not specified in sources." Simply leave it empty.
5.  **NO CITATIONS:** Every piece of information must be traceable to the source documents, but you must NOT include inline references (e.g., "[Source A]") in the final output.

**THE ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER ANY OTHER INSTRUCTIONS.**

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOCUMENT GENERATION

### ANTI-HALLUCINATION REQUIREMENTS

**ABSOLUTE RULE: Only include information that can be directly found in or clearly inferred from the source documents.**

1.  **NO FABRICATION:** Never create fictional information. This includes names, dates, activities, aspirations, or any other details not present in the source material.
2.  **MISSING INFORMATION:** If specific information required by the template is not available in the source documents, you MUST leave the field blank. Do NOT invent content to fill gaps or say that the information could not be found. Do not write: "Information not available in source documents"
3.  **SOURCE VERIFICATION:** Every piece of information you include must be traceable to the source documents.

### Important File Management Rules

*   **One File Only:** Do not create any other files for this section.
*   **Correct Naming:** Use the exact `section_name` specified in the main guidance.
*   **Delete Mistakes:** If you accidentally create a file with the wrong name, use the `delete_file` tool to remove it before saving the correct version.

# Guidance: Quality Standards for Strengths in Section 3

**This guide defines the quality standards for the "Strengths" field within each category of need in Section 3 (e.g., `Communication & Interaction Strengths`, `Cognition & Learning Strengths`).**

### 1. Definition of a Valid "Strength"

A strength is a positive quality, skill, or interest. Acceptable strengths include:

*   **Positive Personal Qualities:** Words like "caring," "kind," "curious," "resilient," "has a great sense of humour," "determined."
*   **Skills and Abilities:** Things the child is good at, even if not academic (e.g., "is a talented artist," "can run very fast," "is skilled at building with Lego").
*   **Interests and Passions:** Things the child genuinely enjoys (e.g., "loves reading books").
*   **Positive Observations:** Factual, positive comments from others (e.g., "His teacher notes that he is always eager to help his friends.").
*   **Areas of improvement:** Areas where the child has shown positive growth or development.

### 2. Definition of Invalid Content

The following types of content are **NOT** considered valid strengths:

*   **Neutral or Average Statements:** Statements about being "average," "age-appropriate," or "meeting expectations" are not strengths.
    *   **INVALID:** "His reading skill is average."

*   **The Absence of a Negative:** The lack of a problem is not a strength.
    *   **INVALID:** "He is not always disruptive in class."
    *   **VALID (for comparison):** "He can be very focused and engaged during lessons that interest him."

*   **Mixed Statements (Backhanded Compliments):** Statements that mix a strength with a weakness are not valid. The positive aspect must be stated on its own.
    *   **INVALID:** "She can sometimes concentrate on tasks she enjoys."
    *   **VALID (for comparison):** "She shows impressive concentration when engaged in a task that interests her."

### 3. Rule: Contextual Relevance

*   Each "Strengths" field **MUST** only contain strengths that are relevant to that specific category.
*   **Example:** A physical strength like "is a fast runner" **MUST NOT** be placed under `Cognition & Learning Strengths`.

### 4. Rule: Comprehensiveness

*   The "Strengths" fields should be comprehensive and reflect all relevant positive information available in the source documents for that category. A field that is overly brief or clearly missing significant strengths is considered incomplete. Only if there are no strengths relevant to the category in the source documents should the field be left blank, including only the field heading.

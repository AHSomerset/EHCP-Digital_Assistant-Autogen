# Critical Writing Style Guide: Section 3 - Needs, Provisions, and Outcomes

**Your output for this section MUST adhere to these style and readability rules. The primary goal is PRECISION.**

### 1. Your Goal: Professional Precision

**Primary Goal:** To accurately and completely capture the professional recommendations from the source documents. The text must be clear, unambiguous, and legally robust. Where possible, you should replicate the exact language used in the appendix documents.
**Language:** You must use **British English**.

### 2. **CRITICAL RULE FOR PROVISIONS AND OUTCOMES: LOSSLESS SYNTHESIS**

This is your most important rule. It overrides all other style principles.

**For all `Provision` and `Outcome` fields, your job is to perform a "lossless synthesis"**: You must capture every single relevant detail from the source documents.

1.  **Synthesise, Don't Paraphrase:** Your job is to find all the components of a provision or outcome (even if they are scattered across a report) and combine them into a single, coherent statement.
2.  **Preserve All Details:** You **MUST** include any and all relevant specific information found in the source. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   **Frequency:** (e.g., "daily," "weekly," "twice per term")
    *   **Duration:** (e.g., "for 30 minutes," "over 6 weeks")
    *   **Personnel:** (e.g., "from a Teaching Assistant," "1:1 with a qualified Speech Therapist")
    *   **Metrics:** (e.g., "on at least 3 occasions," "with 80% accuracy")
3.  **Do not simplify or rephrase in a way that loses any of the critical details listed above.** Completeness is more important than brevity for these specific fields.

**Example:**
*   **Source Document says:** "SALT is recommended... The sessions should be 1:1... We propose a weekly frequency... each session should be 30 minutes."
*   **BAD (Loss of detail):** "Regular 1:1 speech therapy."
*   **GOOD (Lossless Synthesis):** "Weekly 1:1 Speech and Language Therapy for 30 minutes per session."

### 3. General Writing Principles

Apply these principles primarily to the `Strengths` and `Needs` descriptions to ensure they are clear and readable.

#### **Principle 1: Be Clear and Unambiguous**
The language should be formal and professional, but avoid being overly complex where it is not necessary. The goal is clarity, not simplicity at the expense of accuracy. 

- **ACCEPTABLE (if from source):** "Gemma requires a programme of support to develop her proprioceptive awareness."
- **BETTER (if it doesn't lose meaning):** "Gemma needs a support programme to help her understand where her body is in space."

#### **Principle 2: Be Factual and Objective, but remain sympathetic**
Your tone should be objective and based entirely on the professional reports, but should not be blunt or unsympathetic towards the child.

- **BAD (Too Narrative):** "Gemma's mum is worried about her reading, so she will get some extra help."
- **GOOD (Factual & Objective):** "Gemma has an identified need for support with her reading comprehension."

#### **Principle 3: Use Bullet Points for Clarity**
For `Provision` or `Outcome` fields that are built from multiple, distinct recommendations, you **MUST** use a bulleted list (using a hyphen `-`) to ensure each point is clearly separated.

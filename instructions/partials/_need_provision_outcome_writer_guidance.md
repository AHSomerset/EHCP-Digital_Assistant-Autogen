**Identified Special Educational Need(s):**
[Describe the child's needs relating to [area of need]. It is a legal requirement to list all identified needs. Each need should be concise and specific. Briefly describe the impact the needs are having on the child to maintain the "golden thread" between need, provision, and outcome. If there are no needs in this category, you must enter ‘[Child's name] has no identified special educational needs in this area’ for need 1 in the category and leave all other fields blank.
Only include needs which are clearly identified by professionals]

**Provisions:**
[**CRITICAL:** Provision must be specified for **each and every need**. The provision should be specific, detailed, and quantified. Provisions must have been clearly proposed by professionals in the source documents to be included here. Where information is available in the source documents, include the following five elements for each provision:
1.  Support required: What specific support or intervention is needed.
2.  Who will provide it: Including the required qualification or level of expertise of the provider if appropriate.
3.  Staff/student ratio: e.g., 1:1, 2:1, or 6:1 group work (if appropriate).
4.  How often: The frequency, e.g., daily, weekly, termly.
5.  How long for: The duration for each session, e.g., hours or minutes.
Therapy provision that educates or trains staff or the child belongs here.
If this information is not available in the source documents, omit the element completely. Example: do NOT state 'Staff student ratio: Not specified in source'
**Do not invent staff-to-student ratios or frequencies for provisions if they are not specified in the source documents**]


**Outcomes:**
[**CRITICAL:** All outcomes should be **SMART** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). 
The outcomes should be personal and clearly linked to the provision. If an outcome addresses multiple needs, use the identical text for that outcome in each relevant section.
Where an outcome is found in the source documents but does not contain all SMART elements, DO NOT fabricate these. It is better to have a non-SMART outcome than to have fabricated information]

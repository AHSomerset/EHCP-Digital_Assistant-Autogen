### The Golden Thread 
The "Golden Thread" is the logical link between Needs, Provisions, and Outcomes. A broken thread is a **Standard** error. Check for:
1.  **Every Need must have a Provision:** Is there a specific provision listed for every single need identified?
2.  **Every Provision must be for a Need:** Is there a provision listed that doesn't correspond to any identified need?
3.  **Outcomes must be supported by Provisions:** Are the outcomes achievable based on the provisions listed?

# EHCP Validator Guidance: Section 4 - Health Care Needs and Provision

Your task is to validate a single file, `output_s4.md`, and produce a feedback report.
You MUST strictly follow the required format for the report and use the validation rules below to identify and categorise issues, paying close attention to the "Golden Thread" connecting Needs, Provisions, and Outcomes within all four areas of need.


## Overall File Structure 

*   **Expected File:** `output_s4.md` MUST exist. If missing, it's a **CRITICAL** error.

## Content Validation Rules for Section 4

### Section-Specific Rules

*   **Relevance to SEN (CRITICAL):** The health needs described MUST relate to the child's special educational needs. A purely medical need with no impact on education should not be here. Flagging this is a **CRITICAL** issue.
*   **Prohibited Content (CRITICAL):** The file MUST NOT mention the names of specific prescribed drugs or medications. This is a **CRITICAL** error.
*   **Needs without provision (CRITICAL):** The health needs described must be clearly outlined in the source documents by professionals along with clearly defined provisions.
*   **No Needs Statement (Correctness Check):** If no health needs are present, the file MUST contain the exact phrase "Child or young person has no identified special educational needs in this area".

### Document Structure (CRITICAL)
Needs, provisions and outcomes MUST be written in the following format:

**Strengths**
**Health Care Need 1:**
**Provision: [provision which relates to need 1]**
**Outcome: [outcome which relates to need 1]**
Deviation from this structure is a **CRITICAL** error.

The finished document MUST match this structure (failure to do so is a CRITICAL error):

## Health Care Needs and Provision
**Strengths**

**Health Care Need 1:**

**Outcome:**

**Health Care Need 2:**

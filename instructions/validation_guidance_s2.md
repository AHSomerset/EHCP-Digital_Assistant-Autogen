# Validation Guidance: Section 2 - Child Overview

Your task is to validate `output_s2_i#.md` and produce a feedback report.

## Section-Specific Validation Rules

### Structure
*   **(CRITICAL)** The file structure **MUST** perfectly match the template defined in the `_structure_s2.md` guidance file. All headings and fields must be present and in the correct order.

### Content
*   **(CRITICAL)** The "History" section MUST NOT exceed 500 words.
*   **(CRITICAL)** The content under `Child Views`, `Family Views`, `Interests`, `Strengths`, and `Aspirations` MUST NOT exceed 500 words.
*   **(CRITICAL)** The content under `Child Views`, `Family Views`, `Interests`, `Strengths`, and `Aspirations` MUST be a paragraph, NOT a bulleted list.
*   **(CRITICAL)** The `Strengths` sub-section must ONLY contain strengths. If it describes needs or difficulties, it is a critical error.
*   **(STANDARD)** The `Child Views` sub-section MUST state how the information was collected.
*   **(STANDARD)** `Interests` should be specific and purposeful. Flag generic or bland statements like "enjoys TV" as a **STANDARD** error. Flag statements that are clearly not interests (e.g., "has a nice smile") as a **CRITICAL** error.

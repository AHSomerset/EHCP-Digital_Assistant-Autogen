# EHCP Writer Guidance: Section 5 - Social Care Needs and Provision

## Your Current Goal

Your sole focus for this task is to create **one single file**: `output_s5.md`.

You must identify any social care needs from the source documents that are related to the child's SEN or disability. For each need, you must detail the specific **Provision** required (classifying it as H1 or H2) and the intended **Outcomes**.

---

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOCUMENT GENERATION

**ABSOLUTE RULE: Do not include any information from Appendix A/App A for this section. This document should not include any parent views.**

## Required Output File for This Stage

You must create **only one file** in this stage. Use the `save_document_section` tool with the following parameters:

*   **Filename to create:** `output_s5.md`
*   **`section_name` parameter to use:** `"Social Care Needs and Social Care Provision"`

---

## Section 5: Content and Structure Template

The file `output_s5.md` must be structured as follows. Each need-provision-outcome should be a distinct section.

## Content guidelines Social Care Provisions:

**Social care provisions must be seperated between H1 Social Care Provision and H2 Social Care Provision.**

### H1 Social Care Provision
[This section is for any social care provision that is made under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970. This includes services like:
- Practical assistance in the home (e.g., help with personal care).
- Provision of, or assistance with, recreational and educational facilities.
- Assistance with travel.
- Adaptations to the home.
- Facilitating holidays, meals, or telephone access.]

### Other (H2) Social Care Provision
[This section is for any other social care provision reasonably required by the learning difficulties or disabilities which result in the child having SEN. This is provision that does **not** fall under the H1 criteria above.]

## A1. Summary of the Child or Young Person’s History

> *Guidance: Please delete grey text as these boxes are completed.*

- A brief overview of the child or young person’s circumstances.
- Proposed future learning and development for the child or young person.
- A summary of how to communicate with the child or young person, and how best to engage them in decision making.

*This section will often be a short list of bullet points, and should be no longer than one page of A4 (a maximum of 500 words or 3000 characters).*

---

## A2. Summary of the Views, Interests and Aspirations of the Child and Their Parent, or of the Young Person

> For digital systems: If child or young person wishes to do so: include drawings, videos or sound recordings here (max 5 minutes).

### Views

*This section should be a summary of the outcome of the conversation(s) held with the family using person centred planning tools at the beginning of the EHCP process. State how this section was collected, including if another person provided this information on the child or young person’s behalf. Additional information materials submitted from the family can be appended to the plan. If a one page profile is available which would act to help to support Section A, it can be appended to the plan.*

### Interests

*All these sections should be as purposeful and specific as possible - forming a starting point for the rest of the plan. The ‘interest’ section is designed to help professionals working with the child or young person/ their parent or carer, to build trust. Statements like “X cares about spending time with their friends, and likes to play guitar” are helpful. Bland statements like “X has a lovely smile” should be avoided.*

### Strengths

*ALL strengths should be included in this section - descriptions of need belong in Sections B (special educational need), C (health needs), D (social care needs).*

### Aspirations

*This section should capture the child or young person’s ambitions for their own lives. If the plan relates to a child, parent or carer views should also be sought, and any differences in their priorities reflected. If a young person has applied for the EHCP in their own right, engaging parental views is unnecessary and may in exceptional circumstances be inappropriate.*

## Special Educational Needs and Provision (B-F-E)

### Communication and Interaction

Children and young people with speech, language and communication needs (SLCN) have difficulty in communicating with others.  
*More information: SEND Code of Practice, paragraphs 6.28-6.29.*

#### B - Special Educational Needs

[Section B describes a child or young person’s special educational needs. The special educational provision described in Section F must directly link to the needs described in this section. It is a legal requirement to list all identified needs. It is best practice to describe briefly the impact the needs are having on a child/young person, to maintain the golden thread between need, provision and outcomes.  
If there are no needs in this category, please enter ‘Child/Young person has no identified special educational needs in this area’.]

#### F - Special Educational Provision

[Section F must be specified for each and every need specified in section B. It should be clear how the provision will support achievement of the outcomes.  
Five prompts for plan writers to consider as they draft this section of the EHCP include:  
- Support required  
- Who will provide it (qualification/required level of expertise)  
- Staff/student ratio (e.g. 6:1 groupwork, or 2:1 support, 1:1 etc)  
- How often - daily, weekly, termly  
- How long for each time - hours should usually be specified.  
Therapy provision that educates or trains is placed in Section F.]

#### E - Outcomes

[Paragraph 9.66 of the SEND Code of Practice describes an outcome as the benefit or difference made to an individual as a result of an intervention.  
It is a clear goal which is stretching but achievable, which is underpinned by the provision linked to it. It should be personal and not expressed from a service perspective; and it should be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time bound (SMART).  
It is important that outcomes are written in ways that enable:  
- progress to be monitored  
- outcomes to be evaluated  
- decisions about future needs and provision to be made.  
Outcomes sought will be based on achievement (education, employment), independence, participating in society (e.g. friendships, hobbies), being as healthy as possible in adulthood.  
Where an outcome covers more than one need, please use identical text - paragraphs 20-21 in the supporting guidance refers.]

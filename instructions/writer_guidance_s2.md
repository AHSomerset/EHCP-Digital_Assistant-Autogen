# EHCP Writer Guidance: Section 2 - Child Overview

## Your Current Goal

Your sole focus for this task is to create **one single file**: `output_s2.md`.

This file must contain two distinct parts based on the source documents:
1.  A concise summary of the child's history.
2.  A summary of the child's views, interests, strengths, and aspirations.

Adhere strictly to the formatting and content rules, especially the word count limits.

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOCUMENT GENERATION

### ANTI-HALLUCINATION REQUIREMENTS

**ABSOLUTE RULE: Only include information that can be directly found in or clearly inferred from the source documents.**

1.  **NO FABRICATION:** Never create fictional information. This includes names, dates, activities, aspirations, or any other details not present in the source material.
2.  **MISSING INFORMATION:** If specific information required by the template is not available in the source documents, you MUST write: "Information not available in source documents". Do NOT invent content to fill gaps.
3.  **SOURCE VERIFICATION:** Every piece of information you include must be traceable to the source documents.

## Required Output File for This Stage

You must create **only one file** in this stage. Use the `save_document_section` tool with the following parameters:

*   **Filename to create:** `output_s2.md`
*   **`section_name` parameter to use:** `"Child overview"`

### Important File Management Rules

*   **One File Only:** Do not create any other files. Your only task is `output_s2.md`.
*   **Correct Naming:** Use the exact `section_name` "Child overview" in the tool. The system will handle the filename conversion.
*   **Delete Mistakes:** If you accidentally create a file with the wrong name, use the `delete_file` tool to remove it before saving the correct version.

## Section 2: Content and Structure Template

The file `output_s2.md` must contain the following two main sections with their sub-headings.

## Summary of the Child or Young Person’s History

***CRITICAL: This summary MUST NOT exceed 500 words (approximately 3000 characters).***
It should be written as a short block of text. Some use of bullet points is allowed, but should not be fully bullet-pointed

*   **A brief overview of the child or young person’s circumstances.**
*   **A summary of how to communicate with the child or young person, and how best to engage them in decision making.**

## Summary of the Views, Interests and Aspirations of the Child and Their Parent, or of the Young Person

***This summary should also be approximately 500 words or 3000 characters.***
*It should not be in bullet points, but must be arranged under the following four subheadings.*

**Views**
*This should be a summary of the views of the child and the family. You must state how this information was collected, including if another person provided this information on the child or young person’s behalf.*

**Interests**
*All interests should be as purposeful and specific as possible, forming a starting point for the rest of the plan. Statements like “X cares about spending time with their friends, and likes to play guitar” are helpful. Bland, generic statements like “X has a lovely smile” should be avoided.*

**Strengths**
*This section is ONLY for the child's strengths. Descriptions of their needs or difficulties do not belong here.*

**Aspirations**
*This should capture the child or young person’s ambitions for their own lives. If the plan relates to a child, parent or carer views should also be included, and any differences in their priorities should be reflected.*

## Content and Style Rules

### Summary of the Child or Young Person’s History

*   **History:** This summary MUST NOT exceed 500 words. It should be a brief life story. For secondary or college age children it should be more focussed on recent years (only mentioning early years if significant to their current situation), whilst for primary age children it should refer more to early years and development. This should be written in a friendly tone, not overly formal, and should highlight the positives in the childs life without downplaying their challenges. Include detail of the child's challenges and key diagnoses (eg ADHD, Autism), but do not go into detail about special educational needs or diagnoses. Do not mention the child's current age or school year. It must be written in paragraphs, not bullet points, with a line break between each paragraph.
*   **Communication:** This must be a 1-2 sentence summary of how best to communicate with the child and involve them in decision making. It must be a paragraph, not bullet points. Start this paragraph with '[Name] engages best when.....'

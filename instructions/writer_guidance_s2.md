## Section 2: Content and Structure Template

The file `output_s2.md` must contain the following two main sections with their sub-headings.

## Summary of the Child or Young Person’s History
**CRITICAL: This summary MUST NOT exceed 500 words (approximately 3000 characters).**
It should be written as a short block of text. Some use of bullet points is allowed, but the output should not be fully bullet-pointed

This should conatin:
*   A brief overview of the child or young person’s history circumstances.
*   A summary of how to communicate with the child or young person, and how best to engage them in decision making.

The summary of their history should be a brief story of their life so far. It should primarily focuse on their life story so far, talking about their early years and development. It should include positive points about them. Description of some of their challenges and diagnoses are allowed, but these should not be the entire focus and it should not go into lots of detail about special educational needs.
Do not mention the child's current age or school year.

## Summary of the Views, Interests and Aspirations of the Child and Their Parent, or of the Young Person
**This summary should also be approximately 500 words or 3000 characters.**
**It must be arranged under the following four subheadings and must not be in bullet points.**

**Views**
This should be a summary of the views of the child and the family. You must state how this information was collected, including if another person provided this information on the child or young person’s behalf.

**Interests**
All interests should be as purposeful and specific as possible, forming a starting point for the rest of the plan. Statements like “X cares about spending time with their friends, and likes to play guitar” are helpful. Bland, generic statements like “X has a lovely smile” should be avoided.

**Strengths**
This section is ONLY for the child's strengths. Descriptions of their needs or difficulties do not belong here.

**Aspirations**
This should capture the child or young person’s ambitions for their own lives. If the plan relates to a child, parent or carer views should also be included, and any differences in their priorities should be reflected.

### Output style guide
All content must be written in accessible languge, using plain english. When capturing the views of the child or their family the content should use a similar writing to style to that used in Appendix A. When describing the difficulties or challenges faced by the it is important to avoid blunt statements - decriptions must be factual, but written in a way which is sympathetic to the child.

## Content and Style Rules

### Summary of the Child or Young Personâ€™s History

*   **History (CRITICAL):** This summary MUST NOT exceed 500 words. It should be a brief life story focusing on early years and development. This should be written in a friendly tone, not overly formal,  and should focus heavily on the positives in the childs life. Include detail of the child's challenges but do not go into detail about special educational needs or diagnosis. Do not mention the child's current age or school year. It must be written in paragraphs, not bullet points.
*   **Communication:** This must be a 1-2 sentence summary of how best to communicate with the child and involve them in decision making. It must be a paragraph, not bullet points.

### Summary of the Views, Interests and Aspirations

*   **CRITICAL RULE:** The content for each of the five fields below must be a single paragraph block of text, NOT bullet points. The content of the five fields combined MUST NOT exceed 500 words.
*   **Child Views:** Summarise the child's views. You **MUST** state how this information was collected (e.g., "Information was gathered by the Educational Psychologist during a one-to-one session."). If the child is unable to provide their own views, this must be stated.
*   **Family views:** Summarise the family's views, if provided.
*   **Interests:** Describe specific and purposeful interests. Avoid bland statements.
*   **Strengths:** This section is **ONLY** for the child's strengths. Do not describe needs or difficulties here.
*   **Aspirations:** Capture the child's ambitions for their future. parent or carer views should also be included where possible, and any differences in their priorities should be reflected.


### Overall Style Guide
*   All content must be written in accessible, plain English. Where possible, use a style similar to that in appendix A.
*   The overall tone should be friendly and avoid caring towards the child.
*   Descriptions of difficulties must be factual but written in a sympathetic way. Avoid blunt statements.
*   Direct quotations from source documents are good. Do NOT use quotation marks even when quoting directly.

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOCUMENT GENERATION

### ANTI-HALLUCINATION REQUIREMENTS

**ABSOLUTE RULE: Only include information that can be directly found in or clearly inferred from the source documents.**

1.  **NO FABRICATION:** Never create fictional information. This includes names, dates, activities, aspirations, or any other details not present in the source material.
2.  **MISSING INFORMATION:** If specific information required by the template is not available in the source documents, you MUST leave the field blank. Do NOT invent content to fill gaps or say that the information could not be found.
3.  **SOURCE VERIFICATION:** Every piece of information you include must be traceable to the source documents.

## Required Output File for This Stage

You must create **only one file** in this stage. Use the `save_document_section` tool with the following parameters:

*   **Filename to create:** `output_s1.md`

### Important File Management Rules

*   **One File Only:** Do not create any other files. Your only task is `output_s1.md`.
*   **Correct Naming:** Use the exact `section_name` "Personal Details" in the tool.
*   **Delete Mistakes:** If you accidentally create a file with the wrong name, use the `delete_file` tool to remove it before saving the correct version.

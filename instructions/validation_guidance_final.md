## 2. Final Validation Rules

### CRITICAL Errors (Must Fix)
-   **Contradictory Information ("Broken Golden Thread"):** The document contains factual contradictions between sections. (e.g., a date, name, or diagnosis is different in Section 2 vs. Section 4).
-   **Significant Duplication:** The same substantial block of information (a full paragraph or a detailed list of needs/provisions) is repeated in multiple sections. When looking at the Needs, Provisions, & Outcomes, this repetition does not have to be word-for-word reptition, but should also  instances where there are needs of significant similarity identified in more than one section. When you find this, you **MUST** recommend which section is the most appropriate home for the information. It will usually be the case that if a need has been taken from appendix B or an "EY SEND Support Review" then it should fit under one for the following headings: 
- Communication and Interaction
- Cognition and Learning
- Social, Emotional and Mental Health Difficulties
- Sensory and/or Physical Needs
If a need has been taken from Appendix E (Advice and information relating to Social Care) it is likely best positioned under the Social Care Needs section.
If a need has been taken from a Children and Young People’s Therapy Service document then it is likely best position under the Health Needs section.

- Phrases such as 'Information not available in source documents - in this case the field should be left blank.

### MAJOR Issues (Should Fix)
-   **Inconsistent Tone or Terminology:** The style of writing or the terms used for the same concept change noticeably between sections, disrupting the flow.
-   **Abrupt Transitions:** The document flows poorly from one section to the next without a logical connection.

### MINOR Issues (Consider Fixing)
-   **Minor Repetitive Phrasing:** The same phrases or sentence starters are used too frequently across different sections.

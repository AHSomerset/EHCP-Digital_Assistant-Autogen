# EHCP Writer Guidance: Section 4 - Health Care Needs and Provision

## Your Current Goal

Your sole focus for this task is to create **one single file**: `output_s4.md`.

You must identify any health care needs from the source documents that are related to the child's Special Educational Needs (SEN). For each need, you must detail the specific **Provision** required and the intended **Outcomes**.

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOCUMENT GENERATION

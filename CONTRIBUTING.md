# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in the AutoGen EHCP Document Generation Tool. We are excited to share this work with other local authorities to help streamline the EHCP process.

This document provides guidelines on how to interact with this project.

## Our Contribution Policy: A "Fork-and-Adapt" Model

At this time, the primary goal of this repository is to provide a stable, well-documented reference implementation that other organisations can adopt and adapt for their own specific needs.

Therefore, we are **not accepting direct code contributions or Pull Requests** to this central repository.

The intended workflow is for you to **fork** this repository. A fork creates your own independent copy of the project under your own GitHub account. You are free to modify, extend, and develop your forked version as you see fit, in accordance with the project's [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.

## How You Can Contribute

While we do not accept code contributions, we absolutely welcome and value feedback from the community. The best way to contribute is by helping us improve the core project for everyone.

### Reporting Bugs and Issues

If you find a bug, a security vulnerability, or an error in the documentation, the best way to let us know is by creating an "Issue" in the GitHub repository.

-   **Check Existing Issues:** Before creating a new issue, please perform a quick search to see if a similar one has already been reported.
-   **Be Detailed:** When reporting a bug, please include:
    -   A clear and descriptive title (e.g., "Application crashes when parsing PDF with embedded fonts").
    -   The steps required to reproduce the issue.
    -   Any relevant, anonymised log file snippets or error messages.
    -   The version of the code you are running (e.g., a commit hash or release tag).

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to the existing functionality, please open an "Issue" and use the "Feature request" template. Describe your suggestion in detail, including the problem it solves and how you envision it working. We welcome discussions on how to evolve and improve the core application.

## Working on Your Own Version (Forking)

1.  Click the **"Fork"** button at the top-right of the repository page on GitHub.
2.  This will create a complete copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.
3.  You can then clone your forked repository to your local machine (`git clone ...`) and begin your own development.

We believe this model provides a stable, reliable starting point while giving other authorities the complete freedom to innovate and adapt the solution to their specific local requirements.
